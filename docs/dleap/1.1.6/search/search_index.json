For example, the tab order of form items is set to start at the first item on the page, and work through consecutive items. You do not have to reset the tab order if you must add items to the beginning of a form. There are several things that you can do to make your forms more accessible to users with disabilities:</p> <ul> <li>During the creation of your application, accessibility standards, such as WCAG 2.0, should be considered with regards to layout and content. Leap does not prevent authors from creating non-accessible forms.</li> <li>When you add items to your form, give each form item a clear description or name. Screen readers read the name that is associated with a form item. You can also use a Text item as a data label instead of the field provided. For more information, see Using a Text item as a label.</li> <li>Add hints to each form item by modifying the Add hint field. The Hint provides more information when read to the user. For example, if your form has a Name field, the hint tells the user your preference for how to enter their given and surnames.</li> <li>Text blocks are not automatically part of the tab order. Screen readers do not put focus on text blocks, and your users might miss vital information. To ensure that text information is not omitted, select the text item, in the properties side panel, select the check box for Add to tab order. The text is added to the tab order, and is read by screen readers.</li> <li>If you add images or media items to your forms, open the Properties side panel and add descriptive text to the Alternative text property. A screen reader uses the alternative text to describe the image or media item to the user.</li> <li>You can add text items to your form and have them associate with other form items. You can use this technique to create formatted titles for your form items. However, you must link the text item and the form item together. For example, you have a Select One item on your form. You want its title to be rich text so it can have a color, background, and format different from the default title. You add the title with the Text form item, which gives the formatting you want. However, the text item is not read by the screen reader, and the user might not know what the choice list represents. To ensure that the Text field is read by a screen reader, go to the choice list Properties side panel. Insert the name of the Text field into the Accessibility \u2013 Alternative label ID field. A screen reader reads the appropriate text for the choice list.</li> <li>When using the new dynamic layout, it might be necessary to group items into Sections to convey the proper meaning to users. For example, when creating a custom label via the alternative text ID option.</li> <li> <p>When using Sections, if a label exists, it provides a navigation landmark using WAI-ARIA that is available to assistive technologies.

Copy the hasItems and getItem functions into the onLoad event, in addition to the following code:</p> <pre><code>// add all the fields that you want to be required and their custom error text to the object array\napp.getSharedData().requiredMap = new Array();\napp.getSharedData().requiredMap.push({id: 'F_SingleLine2', msg: 'Please enter name.'});\napp.getSharedData().requiredMap.push({id: 'F_SingleLine3', msg: 'Please enter address.'});\napp.getSharedData().requiredMap.push({id: 'F_SingleLine', msg: 'Please enter age.'});\n\n// This function is used for retrieving an item from the requiredMap by ID specified\napp.getSharedData().getArrayVal = function(id) {\n  var theMsg = \"\";\n  for(var i=0; i&lt;app.getSharedData().requiredMap.length;i++) {\n    var tmp = get(app.getSharedData().requiredMap, i);\n    if (tmp.id === id) {\n      theMsg = tmp.msg;\n      break;\n    }\n  }\nreturn theMsg;\n}\n\n/*\n* This is the function where you place the logic that you want to perform on the item that you are currently looking at.\n* The recursive function passes the handle to the current item, from which you can then access any of its properties\n*/\napp.getSharedData().isFormValid = true;\napp.getSharedData().processItem = function(item) {\n  if(item.getType() === \"text\") {\n\n    // do your thing\n    var theMsg = app.getSharedData().getArrayVal(item.getId());\n    if(theMsg !== \"\") {  //item is a required item\n      if(item.getValue() === \"\" || !item.getBOAttr().getValid()) {\n        app.getSharedData().isFormValid = false;\n        item.getBOAttr().setValid(false, theMsg);\n      }\n    }\n\n    var ev = \"onItemChange\";\n    // add an onItemChange Listener - the code within will be called when the fields value changes\n    var hndl = item.connectEvent(ev, function(success){\n      var v = item.getBOAttr().getValue();\n      if(v !== \"\") {\n        item.getBOAttr().setValid(true, \"\");\n      }\n  }); // end of dynamic event listener\n  } // end if item.getType\n}\n</code></pre> <p>The code is then triggered from the validateButtonPressed event:</p> <pre><code>if(pActionId === 'S_Submit') {\n\n  // reset valid flag for multiple submit attempts in one session\n  app.getSharedData().isFormValid = true;\n\n  // walk all form items looking for invalid fields\n  app.getSharedData().getItem(form, app.getSharedData().processItem);\n  if(!app.getSharedData().isFormValid) {\n    return false;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"cr_adding_custom_behavior.html#inactive-form-time-out","title":"Inactive form time-out","text":"<p>This example simulates a forced time-out.

You can add any custom transport installation to the Domino Leap installation by placing an appropriate JAR file in a specific directory on the Domino Leap server; however, Domino Leap already includes a generic HTTP transport which can send and receive data over the internet or intranet, and will suffice for many use cases. For more information, see Service Description.</li> <li>Service Descriptions \u2013 The Service Description provides the interface for a Service Transport. A Service Description is usually described by an XML file, although it is also possible to programmatically create a Service Description. The Service Description specifies a service's name, description, input parameters, and output parameters. These attributes are what appear to the application designer when they are hooking up services to a Domino Leap application.</li> <li>Data Mapping \u2013 Each service description can contain an optional \u201cmapping\u201d component which describes how the data coming from the Service Transport can be mapped to the outputs defined in the Service Description, or vice versa. The advantage of the mapping component is that it allows multiple Service Descriptions, each with its own name, description, input, and outputs to use to use the same generic transport. By using XPath-like references, the mapping component supports the mapping of complex data structures such as an XML document. The mapping of constant values is also supported.</li> <li>Service Configuration \u2013 The Service Configuration is another layer of mapping meant for application designers. It maps items in the form to the inputs and outputs of the Service Description. The application designer is responsible for creating service configurations and connecting form items to the service inputs and outputs. Service configurations are stored inside the application.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"cr_using_apps_exposing_service_to.html#supporting-documents","title":"Supporting documents","text":"<p>Use the following documents to gain a better understanding of the steps required to expose a service to Domino Leap.</p> <p>Understanding the HTTP transport \u2013 The HTTP Service Transport provides a mechanism to communicate with HTTP servers. The transport allows configuration of the URL to request, HTTP method to use, query parameters, and request headers. When combined with the service mapping engine of Domino Leap, the HTTP Service Transport can extract data from an HTTP response and make it available to your application. The HTTP Service Transport can be used to communicate with any standard HTTP server. While there are some limits on the capabilities of the HTTP Service Transport, it is all that is needed to communicate with a basic HTTP server, or RESTful service, in most cases.

Or, you can search a list of products that are maintained by another application. The ability to share data is a powerful feature of Domino Leap.</p> <p>To use an application as a service, the designer of an application must set the requisite permissions on the Access tab of the application. Access can be set for Read, or Read/Write. If you set Read access, other applications are able to Retrieve and Search information from a specific application. If you set Read/Write access, other applications are able to Retrieve, Search, Delete, and Submit information to and from a specific application. For more information about setting permissions, see Defining permissions to share data with other applications.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>When you use another Domino Leap application as a service, mandatory items must be explicitly mapped in the service mapping Inputs and Outputs.

If any value is marked as mandatory, it must have a value that is mapped to it in the mappings dialog.</p> <p>When mapping input parameters, each target has a Search Operator that can change how the inputs are interpreted. For example, you can apply a search operator to create an assignment that links the input with the target, and the operator. To apply the operator, you have to set the View to constant and then type the operator keyword in the editable field.

The default sort order is ascending. To change it to descending, you must prefix your sort field with \u201cDESC\u201d. For example, the following string sorts ascending, <code>\"F_Name\"</code>. The following string sorts descending, <code>\"DESCF_Name\"</code>.</p> <p>The following values are available for you to use when you are searching with metadata:</p> Metadata field Sort key Last update time <code>\"lastUpdated\"</code> Author name <code>\"itemAuthor\"</code> Stage name <code>\"flowState\"</code> Line ID <code>\"dbId\"</code> <p>You can also limit the results by setting a Page Size that limits how many entries you return, or a Page, which limits pages to return.

A list of all applications and methods available for Service mapping is shown. Each application can expose the following methods that are based on Access settings:</p> <p>Retrieve :   Use Retrieve retrieve a single record from another application. For example, use Retrieve to pre-populate information that is based on an employee serial number that is entered by the user into the form. The retrieve returns a single row, and cannot be mapped to a repeating or list item.</p> <p>Search :   Use Search to return a list of records from another application that meets the search criteria. For example, use Search to populate a drop-down with a list of values from another Domino Leap application. The results from a search must be mapped to a repeating/list, drop-down, or table item.</p> <p>Delete :   When Delete service method is called, it deletes the record in the target application that meets the supplied parameters.

Adobe\u2122 Acrobat Pro is the primary tool that is used for creating PDFs where you can complete fields, and can be used to reliably create or modify existing PDFs to make them compatible with the Domino Leap document integration feature.</li> <li>In some cases, Adobe Acrobat Reader extensions are removed by Reader after the document is populated.</li> <li>XFA PDFs have partial support when they have \u201ccompatibility mode\u201d enabled.</li> <li>Encrypted PDFs cannot be populated.</li> <li>Some PDF documents are intended only for printing and have no data entry fields. These PDFs cannot be populated.</li> <li>A number of freely available PDF authoring tools on the web do not create compatible PDFs. Some PDF documents that are created or modified with these tools might appear to have direct text entry support but do not allow completion of fields.</li> <li>If a PDF has limitations that make it unusable for populating with data from Domino Leap, you can still attach the PDF to the form and it is returned unmodified. This is useful if you want to return a static PDF containing detailed instructions.</li> <li>Populating fields in a signed PDF document results in a validation warning message that is displayed by the PDF Reader. The warning message tells users unsigned changes were added after the document was signed.</li> <li>When you work with languages that contain extended character sets, be sure to match the language of the Domino Leap form with the Language/Font of the PDF item. Any character or glyph that is missing from a font is omitted from the value that is passed.</li> <li>The built-in PDF viewer on iOS/Safari does not properly render values of filled PDF's. This is an iOS/Safari limitation.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Mapping information:<ul> <li>Values can be mapped to PDF Text Fields that are marked as readonly. You can populate a PDF from values that are collected in the Domino Leap form, while the PDF remains unmodifiable through direct entry.</li> <li>The design time exercise of creating a map to indicate how data moves from application to the PDF are made much easier when items on both sides are properly named. When you use the Domino Leap mapping dialog, if items in the PDF do not have recognizable names, Adobe Acrobat Pro can be used to modify the PDF.</li> <li>Take care to understand the format and constraints of the item you are mapping to and from. In some cases, a poorly matched map results in a blank item in the PDF because no value is mapped. For example, mapping a Number into a PDF Date Text Field, or mapping multiple selections from a Select Many choice item into a PDF Radio Group. In other cases, a value appears in the PDF but might result in constraint violations within the PDF. For example, mapping an unconstrained Single-Line Entryinto a PDF Field.</li> <li>Multi-lined values cannot be mapped to single lined text fields in a PDF.</li> <li>The Export Values for PDF choice type items can be determined by inspecting the PDF with an editing tool. The Export Values are also displayed as part of the Description property in the extra information hover text within the Domino Leap mapping dialog. To see the Export Values, hover over the information icon next to any PDF item in the list to be mapped. For a successful map, the Saved Value for the Domino Leap item should be adjusted to match the Export Value.</li> <li>To map choice items, the Saved Value for the selected choice must match the Export Value for the available choice in the PDF item. The Export Value is used as an indicator of whether a particular choice in the item is marked as selected, or turned \u201con\u201d. This note is applicable to Domino Leap choice items such as Select One, Select Many, Drop Down, Survey, and Choice Slider.</li> <li>When you map a Check Box to a PDF Check Box, the Export Value is automatically determined so no special consideration needs to be made around matching the Export Value.</li> <li>Select Many<ul> <li>A Select Many can be mapped into a PDF Radio Group. However, configure theSelect Many with a constraint that allows only one choice selection so the constraints of the PDF Radio Group are not violated</li> <li>A Select Many should not be mapped to a cluster of PDF Check Boxes if the PDF Check Boxes do not have unique Export Values. In this case, the Domino Leap form might need to be altered to replace the Select Many item with a cluster of individual Checkboxes.</li> <li>A Select Many maps well to a PDFList Box Multi-Select but can also be mapped to a cluster of PDF Check Boxes by creating multiple maps. One map from the Select Many to each Check Box in the cluster. When mapping from a Select Many to a PDF Check Box, the Saved Value of a selected choice must match the Export Value of the PDF Check Box for the PDF check box to be turned on.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Each question in a Survey must be mapped separately, and must use the same rules for mapping as a Select One or Select Many.</li> <li>Domino Leap tables are repeating rows of data and cannot be mapped directly into a PDF.</li> <li>Some Domino Leap items that cannot be mapped are Image, HTML Fragments, Text, Button, Line, Media, Web Link, Attachment, Page Navigation, Section, and Tabbed Folder.</li> <li>Some PDF items that cannot be mapped are Button, Digital Signature, Image, and Text.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Parent topic: Domino Leap document integration</p>"},{"location":"dleap_access_domino_data.html","title":"Accessing data from Existing Domino Applications","text":"<p>Data from existing Domino Databases, that are co-located with Domino Leap, may be accessed by your Domino Leap application.

Forms are a single page, or collection of pages, that create the user interface with which people interact.

Applications gather the submitted input and automatically store the submissions in a database.</p>"},{"location":"get_overview.html#building-forms","title":"Building forms","text":"<p>When you start Domino Leap, you are shown a screen with two tabs on the Forms toolbar: Use and Manage. The Use tab shows a list of all applications that are created by other users to which you have access. The Manage tab is where you create and manage applications. When Domino Leap opens, you are shown the Manage tab, which displays any applications you created, or for which you have edit permissions.</p> <p>To create an application, click New Application, enter a descriptive application name, and select Create. A blank form is displayed.</p> <p>Drag items from the Palette and drop them onto the form. As you add items, you can change the default name of each item directly on the form. Click the name of the widget on the canvas to edit the name.</p> <p>A built-in grid automatically aligns items on the form, and expands vertically when you add items to the form. The default layout is two columns and two rows. However, you have flexibility when you build your form. You can stretch one form item to span across all columns, and you can add and delete columns and rows as needed. Click any border of a column or row to access a menu with options for expanding or contracting your form.</p> <p>When you click the Rules icon, you can create rules for form items or for other objects. You can set a rule to show or hide a form item, page, or other object that is based on user input.</p> <p>Some form items must be edited by changing their properties. For example, you can add the survey questions on the form, but the question titles can be edited only in the properties panel.</p> <p>When an item is selected the properties panel appears on the side of the screen.

For example, you can create a vacation request form that requires the approval of a supervisor, or an award nomination form that requires the approval of both a supervisor and a nomination committee. In the survey form example, the results from the survey are useful feedback, but by adding workflow elements, the curriculum supervisor can review comments before sending them to the instructor. Adding workflow elements is done with Roles and Stages.</p> <p>Adding or editing Roles is done in the Access or Workflow tab. Adding stages is done in the Workflow tab.</p> <p>Roles \u2013 You can create various roles with different levels of access to different information within an application. For example, you can specify that only an administrator can change an application, managers can review submitted data, and users can complete and submit the form. After roles are defined, you can assign users to the roles. Each role can have as many or as few people assigned to it as needed. You can even assign groups to a role. For example, all supervisors are assigned to one role, and all managers are assigned to another role.</p> <p>In the Access tab, each role can either be Open or Closed. If you have a web service, which pre-populates the role information, select Open. For example, you want to use a web service to scan the company email directory and automatically populate the name of the manager. If you do not plan to use web services in your application, leave the role Closed. The user must enter the name of the manager manually when they complete the form.</p> <p>Stages \u2013 Stages are the steps that a form goes through in its lifecycle. For example, in one stage the user submits data. In the next stage, the manager reviews and approves or rejects the submitted data. An application can have as many stages as needed. Stages are also useful as they allow a submitter to save a draft version of the form. For example, on a census form that has multiple pages, the submitter might not have time to complete the whole form in one session. With the Draft button, the user can complete part of the census, save a draft, then return to complete the census later. A stage can hide or display information that is necessary for one user, but not required for another. For example, in our survey form, the curriculum supervisor must see the name of who submitted the feedback. However, to allow for anonymous feedback, the user's name is hidden when the feedback is forwarded from the curriculum supervisor to the course instructor.</p> <p>By default, every form has a Start and Submitted stage. The Start stage is the first stage of every form. The Submitted stage can be modified and other stages added.</p> <p>To create a workflow, add stages in the Workflow tab. You may hover over the stage and click the plus icon, or click on \u201c+ Add Stage\u201d in the properties pane.</p> <p></p> <p>When a new stage is added, you can modify its properties to build the form workflow as needed. For example, you can add a stage to a survey that thanks the user for submitting feedback and sends the curriculum supervisor an email that indicates that new feedback is available. After the feedback is reviewed by the supervisor, another stage can be added to block the user's name and company information and then forward the feedback to the course instructor.</p> <p>At any time during the form building process, you can save and preview your work in a web browser by clicking Preview.</p> <p></p> <p>Ensure that your browser does not block pop-up windows because the preview form opens in a new window. The Submit and Cancel buttons are automatically added to your form, and are displayed when you preview the form.</p>"},{"location":"get_overview.html#deploying-your-application","title":"Deploying your application","text":"<p>When you complete building your form and adding workflow elements, you must deploy your application to make it available to users.

The View Data screen displays all submitted responses in a table. You can sort the submitted results by clicking any of the column titles. Selecting a response displays the submitted data in a new window.</p> <p>Forms that have extra stages have extra buttons in the View Data screen. For example, the curriculum supervisor has a button to accept the feedback, which forwards the feedback to the course instructor. In another example, such as a vacation request form, the manager can either accept or reject the vacation request. If the manager accepts the request, the request is forwarded to Human Resources to log against the available vacation days.

From a single interface, you can design a form, define access privileges, create workflow stages, deploy the application, and review submitted results.</p> <p>Domino Leap makes creating forms easier than before by dramatically reducing the time and effort that is required to deliver compelling, interactive applications. The simple web-based user interface allows a web designer to quickly assemble a series of application screens for web forms. You can also capture data into a relational database and orchestrate notifications with an integrated workflow. Data that is captured in Domino Leap is easily integrated into existing line-of-business systems with a drag-and-drop web service interface.

The access control is made up of two parts: who may discover and work with the service while designing an application, and who may run the service. Users or Groups provided must be in the proper format - it is recommended to use the dialog (by clicking the button with the down arrow) when adding permissions. Adding or removing users does not require a server restart, but there will be a short delay before the changes take effect.</p> <p>Deleting service descriptions and changing service descriptions must be done with care. Applications might depend on any or all of the parameters for the service description, as well as data returned within the service description. Therefore, modifying the structure or ID of parameters, or how data is mapped into the parameters, can potentially cause failures within deployed applications.</p> <p>Deleted service descriptions are unregistered and immediately become unavailable to any applications, deployed or otherwise. It is critical that before de-registering a service description, a check is performed to ensure that there are no applications that are using the service description.</p> <p>In general, adding new parameters or mappings and changing names and descriptions does not cause failures. However, removing existing parameters, changing parameter mapping, or modifying IDs for Service Description, Service Transport, or a parameter, are likely to cause failures.

There are some limits on what the HTTP Service Transport can provide, but in most cases, the HTTP Service Transport is all that is required to communicate with a basic HTTP server, or RESTful service.</p>"},{"location":"ref_service_http_service_transport.html#how-to-use-the-http-service-transport","title":"How to use the HTTP Service Transport","text":"<p>The HTTP Service Transport has numerous parameters to configure it to talk to many HTTP Servers. In many cases, only a subset of the available parameters is needed. However, all the parameters can be used for any Service Description. The following sections provide a high-level outline of the parameters needed to configure specific parts of your HTTP request.</p> <p>Configuring the Request Method</p> <p>All HTTP requests require a request method, which tells the receiving HTTP server what to do with the request. </p> <p>The HTTP Service Transport supports all the basic HTTP request methods, including: GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE. The HTTP Service Transport supports configuring the HTTP request method with the request-method parameter. If this parameter is missing, or does not contain a valid HTTP request method, then the default, GET is used.</p> <p>Configuring the Request URL</p> <p>A URL is required to make an HTTP request. There is no default for this parameter, so it must be provided to the HTTP Service Transport. There are several parameters that affect how the request URL is built: request-url, request-url-postfix, request-url-postfix-encoded, and two dynamic parameters: request-url-postfix-N and request-url-postfix-N-encoded. </p> <p>The HTTP Service Transport constructs the URL by starting with the value of request-url and appending postfixes. If request-url-postfix is present, its value is appended to the value of request-url. Before appending, the HTTP Service Transport URL encodes the value of request-url-postfix if the request-url-postfix-encoded flag is not present or if its value is anything other than true. Encoding allows values containing characters that are not valid to be placed into the URL without any harm. Choosing to not encode a value allows it to be appended without modification to the URL. </p> <p>For example, consider a Service Description that requires the path to a file as input. Since the path might contain slash (/) characters that must be preserved, then request-url-postfix-encoded is set to true. This instructs the HTTP Service Transport to leave the value alone. However, another Service Description might need to include a text string as a path component. In this case, the slash (/) or any other characters are encoded such that they do not interfere with the path. In this second case, the request-url-postfix-encoded parameter is set to false or omitted from the Service Description. </p> <p>In some cases, having a single postfix does not provide enough flexibility. Therefore, the dynamic parameters request-url-postfix-Nand request-url-postfix-N-encoded are used. The N in each of these parameters refers to its order. During processing, the HTTP Service Transport appends the value of these parameters starting with 0 until it finds a missing parameter. As with the single postfix, encoding is optionally performed on each of the parameters before it is added if the value of the request-url-postfix-N-encoded flag is not present or contains any value other than true. </p> <p>For example, if the Service Description contains parameters called request-url-postfix-0, request-url-postfix-1, and request-url-postfix-3, only request-url-postfix-0 and request-url-postfix-1 are appended to the URL.  While building the request URL if a parameter called request-url-postfix is found, the dynamic parameters are ignored. The Service Description developer must make a conscious choice to use these dynamic parameters.</p> <p>Configuring Request Parameters</p> <p>Query parameters are configured using parameters with the prefix request-query-. Text after the prefix is considered to be the name of the query parameter to pass. The value of the query parameter comes from the value of the transport parameter, and is encoded to prevent the URL from being disrupted. All parameters with the request-query- prefix are added to the URL. No guarantees are made as to the order in which the query parameters are added. For example, consider a search service that requires the search criteria term to be passed as a query parameter. In order to communicate with this service, the Service Description must have a parameter called request-query-term.</p> <p>Configuring Request Headers</p> <p>The HTTP Service Transport allows HTTP request headers to be configured using parameters with the prefix request-header-. Text after the prefix is considered to be the name of the header. The value of the request header is the value of the parameter. No escaping or encoding is performed on either the name or value of request headers. Therefore, header configuration must include only characters that are permissible.</p> <p>Configuring the Request Body</p> <p>HTTP allows a body, or entity, to be sent with PUT and POST requests. In order to allow a Service Description to include a request entity, the HTTP Service Transport sends the contents of the request-entity parameter with the request. The contents of this parameter are ignored if the content of request-method is not PUT or POST.</p> <p>Configuring HTTP Authentication</p> <p>The HTTP Service Transport supports HTTP Basic and HTTP Digest authentication schemes. There are  two mechanisms through which the credentials can be configured: hard coded in the Service Description or provided at run time through the Basic Credentials Provider. </p> <p>To hard code the credentials that the HTTP Service Transport uses to authenticate, the request-http-auth-username and request-http-auth-password parameters must be available. The values of these parameters are used during any HTTP authentication challenge for either HTTP Basic or HTTP Digest authentication. The HTTP Service Transport performs any hashing required. Therefore, the values of these parameters must be the plain text version of both the user name and password. </p> <p>Credentials can be provided at run time using the Basic Credentials Provider. Refer to the Service Description and Basic Credentials Provider help topic for more information. The HTTP Service Transport only uses credentials provided by the Basic Credentials Provider if the request-http-auth-username and request-http-auth-password parameters are empty. </p> <p>Note</p> <p>The HTTP Service transport can only use credentials provided by the Basic Credentials provider  if the request-HTTP-auth-username and request-HTTP-auth-password parameters are empty.</p> <p>In addition to HTTP Basic and HTTP Digest authentication, the HTTP Service Transport supports Single Sign on (SSO) authentication using the Cookie Credentials Provider. In the case where the request made through the HTTP Service Transports needs to pass {{ whortP }} authentication cookies, the Cookie Credentials Provider can be used. In general, the Cookie Credentials Provider is configured to pass the LtpaToken and LtpaToken2 cookies. Consult the Service Description and Cookie Credentials Provider help topics for information.</p> <p>Receiving Response Status Information</p> <p>The HTTP Service Transport ensures that the HTTP status code and message are available for consumption. The HTTP status code, for example, 200, 404, or 500, is available in the outbound response-code parameter. Similarly, the outbound response-message parameter contains the status message returned, for example, OK, Not Found, or Server Error.</p> <p>Receiving Response Headers</p> <p>All the headers that are returned in the HTTP response are made available to the service description via dynamic parameters. Each header name is converted to lowercase and appended with response-header-. For example, the content-type header would be available as an outbound parameter called response-header-content-type. The parameter contains the value of the header. In the case where a header contains more than one value, the header values are collapsed into a single comma-separated list.</p> <p>Receiving the Response Body</p> <p>The entire response body, or entity, is made available via the outbound response-entity parameter.</p>"},{"location":"ref_service_http_service_transport.html#specifying-the-http-service-transport-in-a-service-description","title":"Specifying the HTTP Service Transport in a Service Description","text":"<p>The HTTP Service Transport can be used by specifying its unique ID as the value of the transportId element of the Service Description.

Each mapping element is evaluated in the order in which it occurs within the root mapping element.</p> <ol> <li>Look up the source.</li> <li>Convert the source value if required (parse as XML or JSON).</li> <li>Resolve the source reference.</li> <li>Look up the target, if present.</li> <li>Convert the target value if required (parent as XML or JSON).</li> <li>Resolve the target reference.</li> <li>Map the source value to the target value.</li> <li>Evaluate child mapping elements.</li> </ol> <p>To look up the source, the Domino Leap server first needs to determine the scheme. If the scheme is constant, the identified constant is looked up and returned. If there is no constant with the given name, an empty string is used. If the scheme is parameter or transport, then the current context is searched for the named item. For top-level mapping elements, this is the root of the parameter structure. For child mapping elements, this is the result of the lookup, conversion, and resolve operation on its parent. If the named value cannot be found in the current context, the parent context is checked until there are no more parent contexts. If the value does not exist in any context, an empty string is used.</p> <p>The value returned by the lookup operation is then converted into the type specified for the source or target. If the conversion produced an XML or JSON value, the reference is resolved, which returns a subset of the original value.</p> <p>The same lookup, conversion, and resolve operations are then performed on the target of the mapping. Once both the source and target are resolved, the mapping operation begins. Generally, the cardinality of the target matches the source. For example, if a list is the source, then the target must be a list. Similarly, if a single value is the source, then the target must be a single value.</p> <p>When the source is a single value, that value is assigned directly to the target value. When the source is a list, a new list is created to contain the results. For each item in the source list, the child mappings of the current mapping element are evaluated. The results of these mappings are added to the list being constructed. When all the source items are evaluated, the list is assigned to the target value.</p> <p>For more information on creating a Service Description that returns JSON, see the Leap wiki.</p> <p>Parent topic: Service Description</p>"},{"location":"ref_service_service_description.html","title":"Service Description","text":"<p>A Service Description provides a specific interface to a Service Transport. The Service Description describes the inputs and outputs when you configure services within the HCL Domino Leap mapping user interface.</p>"},{"location":"ref_service_service_description.html#elements-of-a-service-description","title":"Elements of a Service Description","text":"<p>A Service Description is represented as an XML document that follows an XML schema. This single XML document contains all the information for a single Service Description: name, description, input and output parameters, and input and output mapping. For a full listing of the XML schema, refer to Appendix A - Service Description schema. The top-level element in a Service Description is the serviceDescription element. This element, and all of its childs, must be in the XML namespace with a URI of http://www.ibm.com/xmlns/prod/forms/services/serviceDescription/1.0.</p> <p>ID</p> <p>Each Service Description must contain a unique id that identifies it to the Domino Leap server. The id can contain any characters that are valid as a component of a URL path. These characters include:</p> <ul> <li>Alphabetical letters \u2013 [A-Z], and [a-z]<ul> <li>Numerals \u2013 [0-9]</li> <li>Hyphens \u2013 [-]</li> <li>Underscore \u2013 [_]</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Because a Service Description ID is a surrogate for the Service Description itself, this ID does not must be descriptive. Any UUID is a valid choice for a Service Description ID because it guarantees uniqueness and contains only characters that are valid in a URL path component.</p> <p>Transport ID</p> <p>A Service Description must reference a Service Transport to perform its underlying operation. Each Service Transport has its own unique transportId that uniquely identifies it to the Domino Leap server. The ID for a Service Transport must be made available by its developer.</p> <p>Name and Description</p> <p>To help users build Domino Leap applications with services, each Service Description contains both a name, and a description. The name and description elements allow you to localize a Domino Leap Service Description in multiple languages using duplicate elements, each with a different xml:lang attribute and contents.See Localizing Service Descriptions for information about how to provide names and descriptions in multiple languages.</p> <p>Default Locale</p> <p>If the Service Description is not localized in the language of a particular user, the defaultLocale contains the locale in which the name and description must be presented. For example, if a user asks for the Service Description in French, but the Service Description has only English and Spanish strings, the English is returned if en is set as the defaultLocale.</p> <p>Credentials</p> <p>The credentials contains the configuration for a Credentials Provider. The ID of the credentials provider is specified in the providerId attribute. The credentials element can contain zero or more property elements to configure the properties of the specified Credentials Provider. </p> <p>Each property element must contain a name attribute whose value is the name of the property being configured, and a value attribute that contains the value of the property. Not all Credentials Providers are applicable to all Service Transports. Therefore, the documentation for each Service Transport must be consulted before you configure the credentials element. If the configured Service Transport does not understand the provider that is specified by providerId, the Service Description is not available.</p> <p>Bindings</p> <p>Every Service Description must specify its input and output structures. These structures outline the ID, name, description, and type of each parameter and any subparameters. In addition to the parameter structure, bindings might also contain a section that declares how data going into the Service Transport is mapped from the input structure and how data coming from the Service Transport is mapped to the output structure.</p> <p>There are two top-level elements for bindings: inbound, and outbound. Inbound defines the binding for data coming into the Service Description from the Builder Application. Outbound defines the data going to the Domino Leap application from the Service Description. Only one of each of these elements can be present within a single Service Description, and each must be placed as a child of the serviceDescription element.</p> <p>Directly underneath inbound and outbound are two elements that define the main components of a binding: parameters and serviceMapping. The parameters element contains all the information that is related to the parameters. The contents of the serviceMapping element instructs Domino Leap how to map data coming from the parameters into data for the transport and vice versa.</p> <p>Parameters</p> <p>The parameters element contains zero or more parameter elements. Each parameter element defines a single parameter coming into or being returned from the Service Description. Each parameter element must have an id, type, name, and description. The id element uniquely identifies the parameter within the binding. The type element specifies the type of data that is expected to be contained within the parameter. The following data types are supported: STRING, BOOLEAN, DECIMAL, FLOAT, DOUBLE, INTEGER, DATETIME, TIME, DATE, and LIST.</p> <p>As with the name and description child elements of the serviceDescription element, these childs of parameter specify the name and description of the parameter that is used in Domino Leap. These elements can also be localized using the xml:lang attribute.</p> <p>Optionally, the mandatory element can be included for inbound bindings to specify whether the parameter must be bound before starting the Service Description. Valid values for this element are true and false, with the latter being the default.</p> <p>Each parameter element can have a child element that is called parameters which is a container for child parameters. The contents of the parameters element is one or more parameter elements. If a parameter contains subparameters, its type is set to LIST. At run time, the parameter contains a list of structures with each of the subparameters.</p> <p>Service Mapping</p> <p>The serviceMapping element contains all the information that is needed for the Domino Leap server to map data between the Service Description parameters, and the Service Transport.

In this example, the URL to which the request is made comes as an inbound parameter from the Builder application.</p> <pre><code>1: &lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;  \n2: &lt;serviceDescription&gt;  \n3:   &lt;id&gt;get-content-type&lt;/id&gt;  \n4:   &lt;defaultLocale&gt;en-us&lt;/defaultLocale&gt;  \n5:   &lt;transportId&gt;HTTPServiceTransport&lt;/transportId&gt;  \n6:   &lt;name xml:lang=\"en-us\"&gt;Get Content Type&lt;/name&gt;  \n7:   &lt;description xml:lang=\"en-us\"&gt;  \n8:  Retrieves the content type of the response from an HTTP server for the configured URL.  \n9:   &lt;/description&gt; \n10:   &lt;inbound&gt; \n11:     &lt;parameters&gt; \n12:       &lt;parameter&gt; \n13:         &lt;id&gt;request-url&lt;/id&gt; \n14:         &lt;type&gt;STRING&lt;/type&gt; \n15:         &lt;name xml:lang=\"en-us\"&gt;URL&lt;/name&gt; \n16:         &lt;description xml:lang=\"en-us\"&gt;URL to request.&lt;/description&gt; \n17:         &lt;mandatory&gt;true&lt;/mandatory&gt; \n18:       &lt;/parameter&gt; \n19:     &lt;/parameters&gt; \n20:   &lt;/inbound&gt; \n21:   &lt;outbound&gt; \n22:     &lt;parameters&gt; \n23:       &lt;parameter&gt; \n24:         &lt;id&gt;response-header-content-type&lt;/id&gt; \n25:         &lt;type&gt;STRING&lt;/type&gt; \n26:         &lt;name xml:lang=\"en-us\"&gt;Content Type&lt;/name&gt; \n27:         &lt;description xml:lang=\"en-us\"&gt;Content Type of the response.&lt;/description&gt; \n28:       &lt;/parameter&gt; \n29:     &lt;/parameters&gt; \n30:   &lt;/outbound&gt; \n31: &lt;/serviceDescription&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>All Service Descriptions begin with a serviceDescription element, and in this example, it is defined in line 2. The serviceDescription element contains all the information that is needed for the Domino Leap server to work with the Service Description. The unique ID of this Service Description is get-content-type as defined in line 3. The unique ID is not exposed to a user, but it must be unique.  Line 5 declares the ID of the Service Transport to use, which is HTTPServiceTransport, and this is the unique ID of the HTTP Service Transport. Lines 7 and 8 define the name and description of the Service Description, which are presented to the user when designing applications.</p> <p>Lines 10-20 define the inbound bindings, and lines 21-30 define the outbound bindings. As mentioned previously, the inbound bindings refer to the parameters that are flowing from the application to the Service Transport. The outbound bindings refer to the parameters that are flowing in the opposite direction.</p> <p>Lines 11-19 contain all the inbound parameters, of which there is only one.  The parameter that is defined in lines 12-18 represents the URL to which a request is made. According to the HTTP Service Transport documentation, the parameter that contains the URL to which the request is made must be called request-url.</p> <p>Line 13 defines the id of the parameter so that it matches the expectations of the HTTP Service Transport.</p> <p>The name and description are defined in lines 15 and 16, and line 17 specifies that this parameter must be supplied in order for this Service Description to operate.</p> <p>Lines 21-30 define the outbound parameters for the Service Description. In this case, there is only one output parameter: the content type of the response. The HTTP Service Transport dynamically creates new parameters that are based on the information that is returned in the HTTP response. In particular, response headers are converted to lowercase and are prefixed with response-header-. Since this Service Description is interested in the Content-Type header, the outbound parameter response-header-content-type is created in lines 23-28 to contain this data.</p> <p>Example 2: Augmenting Parameters with Constants</p> <p>The following Service Description returns the same information as Example 1. However, in this case, we do not want the Domino Leap application to supply the URL. Instead, the URL is declared using a constant, and mapped into the inbound parameters for the Service Transport.</p> <pre><code>1: &lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;\n2: &lt;serviceDescription&gt;\n3:   &lt;id&gt;get-content-type-with-constant&lt;/id&gt;\n4:   &lt;defaultLocale&gt;en-us&lt;/defaultLocale&gt;\n5:   &lt;transportId&gt;HTTPServiceTransport&lt;/transportId&gt;\n6:   &lt;name xml:lang=\"en-us\"&gt;Get Content Type with Constant&lt;/name&gt;\n7:   &lt;description xml:lang=\"en-us\"&gt;\n8:  Retreives the content type of the response from an HTTP server.\n9:   &lt;/description&gt;\n10:   &lt;inbound&gt;\n11:     &lt;serviceMapping&gt;\n12:       &lt;constants&gt;\n13:         &lt;constant&gt;\n14:           &lt;id&gt;url-to-request&lt;/id&gt;\n15:           &lt;value&gt;http://www.hcl.com&lt;/value&gt;\n16:         &lt;/constant&gt;\n17:       &lt;/constants&gt;\n18:       &lt;mapping&gt;\n19:         &lt;mapping source=\"constant:url-to-request\" sourceType=\"string\" target=\"transport:request-url\" targetType=\"string\"/&gt;\n20:       &lt;/mapping&gt;\n21:     &lt;/serviceMapping&gt;\n22:   &lt;/inbound&gt;\n23:   &lt;outbound&gt;\n24:     &lt;parameters&gt;\n25:       &lt;parameter&gt;\n26:         &lt;id&gt;response-header-content-type&lt;/id&gt;\n27:         &lt;type&gt;STRING&lt;/type&gt;\n28:         &lt;name xml:lang=\"en-us\"&gt;Content Type&lt;/name&gt;\n29:         &lt;description xml:lang=\"en-us\"&gt;Content Type of the response.&lt;/description&gt;\n30:       &lt;/parameter&gt;\n31:     &lt;/parameters&gt;\n32:   &lt;/outbound&gt;\n33: &lt;/serviceDescription&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Like Example 1, the Service Description makes a request to an HTTP server and returns the content type of the response. However, this Service Description differs from the Example 1 because there are no input parameters to this service. The request-url HTTP Service Transport parameter is mapped into the transport via a constant.</p> <p>Lines 12-17 define the constants section. There is a single constant that is defined in lines 13-16. This constant has an id of url-to-request specified in line 14, and a value of http://www.hcl.com, specified in line 15. The id of the constant is used when creating the parameter structure that is passed to the Service Transport. This constant is referenced in line 19 within the mapping section.</p> <p>Lines 18-20 contain the mapping information. Since there is only one parameter to be sent, there is only one mapping, which is defined in line 19. This mapping specifies that the value of the Service Transport parameter named request-url is specified by the value of the constant named url-to-request.</p> <p>Example 3: Lists of Data</p> <p>The following Service Description demonstrates the use of nested parameters. This example is the same as the Service Description used for the Countries by Region service that is shipped with Domino Leap. This example describes how to specify a region and return a list of the names of countries within that region.</p> <pre><code>1: &lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;\n2: &lt;serviceDescription&gt;\n3:   &lt;id&gt;countries-by-region&lt;/id&gt;\n4:   &lt;defaultLocale&gt;en-us&lt;/defaultLocale&gt;\n5:   &lt;transportId&gt;4647b8cf-093f-11e0-89dd-001e4cf83606&lt;/transportId&gt;\n6:   &lt;name xml:lang=\"en-us\"&gt;\n7:  Countries by Region using Service Description\n8:   &lt;/name&gt;\n9:   &lt;description xml:lang=\"en-us\"&gt;\n10:     Given a region, return a list of country information in that region.\n11:   &lt;/description&gt;\n12:   &lt;inbound&gt;\n13:     &lt;parameters&gt;\n14:       &lt;parameter&gt;\n15:         &lt;id&gt;region&lt;/id&gt;\n16:         &lt;type&gt;STRING&lt;/type&gt;\n17:         &lt;name xml:lang=\"en-us\"&gt;Region&lt;/name&gt;\n18:         &lt;description xml:lang=\"en-us\"&gt;\n19:           One of \"Africa\", \"America, North\", \"America, South\", \"Asia\", \"Europe\", or \"Oceania\"\n20:         &lt;/description&gt;\n21:         &lt;mandatory&gt;true&lt;/mandatory&gt;\n22:       &lt;/parameter&gt;\n23:     &lt;/parameters&gt;\n24:   &lt;/inbound&gt;\n25:   &lt;outbound&gt;\n26:     &lt;parameters&gt;\n27:       &lt;parameter&gt;\n28:         &lt;id&gt;countries&lt;/id&gt;\n29:         &lt;type&gt;LIST&lt;/type&gt;\n30:         &lt;name xml:lang=\"en-us\"&gt;Countries\"&lt;/name&gt;\n31:         &lt;description xml:lang=\"en-us\"&gt;List of country information&lt;/description&gt;\n32:         &lt;parameters&gt;\n33:           &lt;parameter&gt;\n34:             &lt;id&gt;name&lt;/id&gt;\n35:             &lt;type&gt;STRING&lt;/type&gt;\n36:             &lt;name xml:lang=\"en-us\"&gt;Name&lt;/name&gt;\n37:             &lt;description xml:lang=\"en-us\"&gt;Name of Country&lt;/description&gt;\n38:           &lt;/parameter&gt;\n39:         &lt;/parameters&gt;\n40:       &lt;/parameter&gt;\n41:     &lt;/parameters&gt;\n42:   &lt;/outbound&gt;\n43: &lt;/serviceDescription&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>As with the other Service Description examples, this Service Description has its own unique ID, defined in line 3, a name, which is defined in lines 6-8, and a description, which is defined in lines 9-11. This Service Description uses the sample Countries by Region Service Transport, which is shipped with the Domino Leap , and is identified by its id in line 5.</p> <p>Because this Service Description has a single inbound parameter, the parameters element, in lines 13-23, of the inbound bindings in lines 12-24. parameters contains only a single parameter, which is defined in lines 14-22. The id of this parameter is region, which is what is expected by the Countries by Region Service Transport.</p> <p>Since there can be multiple countries within a region, the outbound bindings, which are defined in lines 25-42, must contain a list parameter to contain all the information for each country. The outbound structure for this Service Description consists of a parameter that is called countries that contains a list of maps. Each of the maps that are contained within the countries list consists of a single name key that contains the name of a country. This structure is defined within the parameters element, which is defined in lines 26-41, of the outbound bindings section. The top-level parameter, countries, is defined between lines 27 and 40. Since the countries parameter contains other parameters, its type is set as LIST in line 29. All the parameters of the list entries are defined within the parameters element inside the countries parameter that is defined in lines 32-39. The single name subparameter is defined in lines 33-38.</p> <p>Since the inbound and outbound bindings directly match what is returned by the Countries by Region Service Transport, there is no need for any mapping information. This service can be set up such that the name subparameter is mapped to list-like items such as drop-down options or an item in a table.</p> <p>Example 4: Mapping XML into Parameters</p> <p>The following Service Description extracts data from an XML document that is returned from an HTTP request using the HTTP Service Transport.</p> <pre><code>1: &lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;\n2: &lt;serviceDescription&gt;\n3:   &lt;id&gt;address-lookup&lt;/id&gt;\n4:   &lt;defaultLocale&gt;en-us&lt;/defaultLocale&gt;\n5:

As with the other Service Description examples, the standard prologue of id, transportId, name, and description is specified in lines 3-7. This service has a single parameter, address, that can be assigned by an application, as specified in lines 10-16. Since this parameter is required to perform the address look-up, it is marked as mandatory in line 15.</p> <p>Since this Service Description uses the HTTP Service Transport, a request-url must be specified. The URL used in this request takes the form http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/xml?address=[address]&amp;sensor=[true|false]. Because there are query parameters that must be sent, this Service Description uses the HTTP Service Transport support for query parameters by prefixing the name of the parameter with request-query-. However, because some of these query parameters are not exposed to the user, you must create a mapping section to map some constant values. The inbound binding constant section, in lines 19-32, defines the three constants that are used: request-url, lines 20-23, false-constant, lines 24-27, and request-method, lines 28-31. These constants contain the URL to which to request is made, a constant string value false for the sensor query parameter, and the request method. While some of these constants, including request-url and request-method, match the name of the parameter to which they are applied, there is no requirement that they match. Parameter names that match do not automatically get a constant value if it has the same name. All mapping must be explicitly defined.</p> <p>In lines 33-38, the mapping section of the inbound binding maps the constants and Service Description parameters to the Service Transport parameters. Each of the mapping elements is fairly self-explanatory: the request-url constant is mapped to the request-url transport parameter; the request-method constant is mapped to the request-method transport parameter; the address parameter is mapped to the request-query-address transport parameter; and the constant false-constant is mapped to the sensor transport parameter.</p> <p>The HTTP Service Transport then builds a URL out of the request-url, request-query-address, and request-query-sensor parameters, and makes a request to that URL using the HTTP method given in the request-method parameter. The response body that is returned by this request is placed in the response-entity transport parameter, which is then taken apart by the mapping section of the outbound bindings.</p> <p>This service expects the response-entity to be similar to the following:</p> <pre><code>1: &lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt; \n2: &lt;GeocodeResponse&gt; \n3:  &lt;status&gt;OK&lt;/status&gt; \n4:  &lt;result&gt; \n5:   &lt;type&gt;street_address&lt;/type&gt; \n6:   &lt;formatted_address&gt;1 New Orchard Rd, Armonk, NY, USA&lt;/formatted_address&gt; \n7:   &lt;address_component&gt; \n8:    &lt;long_name&gt;1&lt;/long_name&gt; \n9:    &lt;short_name&gt;1&lt;/short_name&gt; \n10:    &lt;type&gt;street_number&lt;/type&gt; \n11:   &lt;/address_component&gt; \n12:   &lt;address_component&gt; \n13:    &lt;long_name&gt;New Orchard Rd&lt;/long_name&gt; \n14:    &lt;short_name&gt;New Orchard Rd&lt;/short_name&gt; \n15:    &lt;type&gt;route&lt;/type&gt; \n16:   &lt;/address_component&gt; \n17:   &lt;address_component&gt; \n18:    &lt;long_name&gt;Armonk&lt;/long_name&gt; \n19:    &lt;short_name&gt;Armonk&lt;/short_name&gt; \n20:    &lt;type&gt;locality&lt;/type&gt; \n21:    &lt;type&gt;political&lt;/type&gt; \n22:   &lt;/address_component&gt; \n23:   &lt;address_component&gt; \n24:    &lt;long_name&gt;Westchester&lt;/long_name&gt; \n25:    &lt;short_name&gt;Westchester&lt;/short_name&gt; \n26:    &lt;type&gt;administrative_area_level_2&lt;/type&gt; \n27:    &lt;type&gt;political&lt;/type&gt; \n28:   &lt;/address_component&gt; \n29:   &lt;address_component&gt; \n30:    &lt;long_name&gt;New York&lt;/long_name&gt; \n31:    &lt;short_name&gt;NY&lt;/short_name&gt; \n32:    &lt;type&gt;administrative_area_level_1&lt;/type&gt; \n33:    &lt;type&gt;political&lt;/type&gt; \n34:   &lt;/address_component&gt; \n35:   &lt;address_component&gt; \n36:    &lt;long_name&gt;United States&lt;/long_name&gt; \n37:    &lt;short_name&gt;US&lt;/short_name&gt; \n38:    &lt;type&gt;country&lt;/type&gt; \n39:    &lt;type&gt;political&lt;/type&gt; \n40:   &lt;/address_component&gt; \n41:   &lt;geometry&gt; \n42:    &lt;location&gt; \n43:     &lt;lat&gt;41.1083018&lt;/lat&gt; \n44:     &lt;lng&gt;-73.7204677&lt;/lng&gt; \n45:    &lt;/location&gt; \n46:    &lt;location_type&gt;ROOFTOP&lt;/location_type&gt; \n47:    &lt;viewport&gt; \n48:     &lt;southwest&gt; \n49:      &lt;lat&gt;41.1051542&lt;/lat&gt; \n50:      &lt;lng&gt;-73.7236153&lt;/lng&gt; \n51:     &lt;/southwest&gt; \n52:     &lt;northeast&gt; \n53:      &lt;lat&gt;41.1114494&lt;/lat&gt; \n54:      &lt;lng&gt;-73.7173201&lt;/lng&gt; \n55:     &lt;/northeast&gt; \n56:    &lt;/viewport&gt; \n57:   &lt;/geometry&gt; \n58:  &lt;/result&gt; \n59: &lt;/GeocodeResponse&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>There is much data in this response, but only some of it is needed for this Service Description. The latitude, longitude, and a list of the address information from the first result is required. To get only the required information, the Service Description outlines the parameters that it expects to return in the parameters section, in lines 42-87. The Service Description then uses the mapping section, in lines 88-108, to extract the required data from the response-entity transport parameter. Each of the parameters in the parameters section is self-explanatory. Latitude and longitude are top-level parameters because there is only one of each of them in a single result. However, there are several address_component elements, each of which are returned. Therefore, the address-information parameter is a list parameter that contains subparameters, one for each of the pieces of information in an address_component that the Service Description wants to make available.</p> <p>In lines 88-108, the service mapping section defines all the mapping that must be performed to extract the data from the XML response. Latitude, which is specified in lines 90-93, and longitude, which is specified in lines 94-97, each extract the data using a single XPath expression. The source type for each is set to XML. Mapping of a repeating structure is accomplished in a similar fashion. Lines 98-101 define the mapping for the address-information parameter. The XPath expression for address-information returns a nodeset as there are several nodes that match the expression GeocodeResponse/result/address_component. For each node that is returned, a new structure is created to contain the result of each of the submappings. Each of the submappings places its target into the newly created structure. Since the source of each of the submappings is one of the matched nodes, the mapping elements do not specify a source. It is assumed to be the inherited context. Similarly, the reference is evaluated within the context of the source, which is inherited. After each of the submappings is evaluated for a single source, the structure is added to a running list and the submappings are evaluated again for the next result in the source list. When all the sources are processed, the list that was collecting the results of the map is assigned to the address-information parameter.</p> <p>Example 5.

The form item is placed into the grid location. You can build forms by placing form items directly on the form or grouping form items in Sections. For our coffee feedback form, we use Sections to organize the form items. Sections are useful for the following reasons:</p> </li> <li> <p>They group form items in a way that is easy for the user to understand. When the form is viewed, the sections have specific background colors that are based on the style that is applied to the form.</p> </li> <li>They make applying complex form functionality easier. For example, our form has a rule to hide the survey until the user selects a specific option. Instead of setting the rule on every form item individually, the rule is on the section. The rule applies to every form item within the section.</li> <li>They allow the form designer, and the form user, to collapse and expand entire parts of the form. In longer forms, collapsing sections is useful, as it keeps the form submitter from being overwhelmed by too much information.</li> <li>If you finish building your form and decide to change the layout, moving sections of form items is much easier than moving each form item individually.

For example, in a job application you can build a table that asks for work history. You can create columns such as the \u201cCompany Name\u201d, \u201cJob Title\u201d, \u201cStart Date\u201d, and \u201cEnd Date\u201d. The user can add as many rows under these columns as required to provide their work history. In many cases, it is not feasible to add individual items for each repeating element as you cannot know in advance how many repeating elements the use requires. To achieve this functionality, the Table form item contains the following two complimentary elements:</p> <ul> <li>Child form \u2013 The Child form is a supporting form that contains the form items that collect the repeated data. In the \u201cwork history\u201d example, the child form contains a Date form item for collecting the \u201cStart Date\u201d of a previous job. A child form is similar to a regular form, however it is limited to a single page. When a user completes their job history, the child form is shown in a dialog box. The user can enter as many rows as required to submit a complete job history. In the Outline view, the child form is called \"Table\", and is listed as a subset of the parent page.</li> <li> <p>Table display \u2013 The Table display shows the data entries that are collected by the child form. The columns in the table represent the individual items from the child form. The visibility of specific columns in the table is configurable in the properties side panel.</p> </li> <li> <p>In the Palette, click Specialized.</p> <p>The list of specialized form items expands.</p> </li> <li> <p>Select Table, and drop it onto the form.</p> <p>Adding the table creates a Table child form in the Outline view.</p> </li> <li> <p>In the table, click the link to access the child form, and define the table columns by selecting form items from the Common Palette.</p> <p>Ensure that you give each form item a specific name as the items added to the Table child form become column titles for the table.</p> <p>For example, if you insert a Single Line Entry form item to record someone\u2019s name, you must change the title of the item, or the table on the will display \u201cSingle Line Entry\u201d. The title of the form item is not helpful to users.

The section is a sub-form which the author can design as they wish, with required fields and others. The end-user can then create and fill multiple instances of that section, shown sequentially on the page.  For example, the widget could be used by the app author to ask for a list of vehicles owned by the end-user, with maker, model, and year for each vehicle. </p> <p>The data type of the instantiated custom widget will be a \"business object list\" (BOL). It is expected that a custom repeating section widget will utilize the existing API for BOLs. See Business Object List (BOL) for lists of Business Objects. It is the responsibility of the custom widget to provide the UI for the end-user to trigger the addition (or deletion) of items in the BOL. In turn, Domino Leap will create an instance of the UI (the sub-form) and pass that to the custom widget to place into its DOM. Hence, it is the manipulation of data that drives the UI.</p> <p>The instantiated custom widget must include the following functions:</p> <ul> <li> <p><code>placeDesignForm(formNode)</code>: When the Domino Leap app author places a repeating section widget on the canvas, Domino Leap will create a sub-form (ie. <code>formNode</code>) for the app author to add fields to.

These functions should provide tightly constrained interactions with the custom widget, with no possibility for script injection or access to the widget's internal objects or its DOM, or those of the product.
