For example, the tab order of form items is set to start at the first item on the page, and work through consecutive items. You do not have to reset the tab order if you must add items to the beginning of a form. There are several things that you can do to make your forms more accessible to users with disabilities:</p> <ul> <li>During the creation of your application, accessibility standards, such as WCAG 2.0, should be considered with regards to layout and content. Leap does not prevent authors from creating non-accessible forms.</li> <li>When you add items to your form, give each form item a clear description or name. Screen readers read the name that is associated with a form item. You can also use a Text item as a data label instead of the field provided. For more information, see Using a Text item as a label.</li> <li>Add hints to each form item by modifying the Add hint field. The Hint provides more information when read to the user. For example, if your form has a Name field, the hint tells the user your preference for how to enter their given and surnames.</li> <li>Text blocks are not automatically part of the tab order. Screen readers do not put focus on text blocks, and your users might miss vital information. To ensure that text information is not omitted, select the text item, in the properties side panel, select the check box for Add to tab order. The text is added to the tab order, and is read by screen readers.</li> <li>If you add images or media items to your forms, open the Properties side panel and add descriptive text to the Alternative text property. A screen reader uses the alternative text to describe the image or media item to the user.</li> <li>You can add text items to your form and have them associate with other form items. You can use this technique to create formatted titles for your form items. However, you must link the text item and the form item together. For example, you have a Select One item on your form. You want its title to be rich text so it can have a color, background, and format different from the default title. You add the title with the Text form item, which gives the formatting you want. However, the text item is not read by the screen reader, and the user might not know what the choice list represents. To ensure that the Text field is read by a screen reader, go to the choice list Properties side panel. Insert the name of the Text field into the Accessibility \u2013 Alternative label ID field. A screen reader reads the appropriate text for the choice list.</li> <li>When using the new dynamic layout, it might be necessary to group items into Sections to convey the proper meaning to users. For example, when creating a custom label via the alternative text ID option.</li> <li> <p>When using Sections, if a label exists, it provides a navigation landmark using WAI-ARIA that is available to assistive technologies.

For each theme, two parameters must be set: <ul> <li>customThemes.[ID].displayName</li> <li>customThemes.[ID].location</li> </ul> [ID] - An identifier for the custom theme (e.g. \"corpTheme1\").  The id can contain the letters 'a' through 'z' and numbers, and must start with a letter. displayName - The theme name to be displayed in the Leap authoring UI. location -The full URL of the theme's .css file.  For each theme, there are 2 optional parameters: <ul> <li>customThemes.[ID].isDefault</li> <li>customThemes.[ID].nl.[LOCALE]</li> </ul> isDefault - If set to true, designates the theme as the default selection for new applications. nl.[LOCALE] - For globalization support of the theme's display name. [LOCALE] is the locale code that identifies the language (e.g.,\"en\", \"fr\", \"fr_CA\", \"zh\").  After modifying these settings, restart the Leap server to see the changes in the authoring environment. If the location property of a theme is modified, any deployed applications using that custom theme need to be redeployed for changes to take affect. Examples: <pre><code>customThemes.corpTheme1.displayName = Corporate Theme 1\ncustomThemes.corpTheme1.nl.fr = Th\u00e8me d'entreprise 1\ncustomThemes.corpTheme1.nl.zh = \u4f01\u4e1a\u4e3b\u98981\ncustomThemes.corpTheme1.isDefault = true\ncustomThemes.corpTheme1.location =https://mycompany.com/theme1.css\n</code></pre>  detectBrowser   If Leap detects an unsupported browser, a warning message is displayed to the user. The user can still see the form after the warning message is closed.Where: <ul> <li>warn - The user is warned that the browser is unsupported. A list of supported browsers is displayed in the warning message. When the user closes the warning message, the form is displayed.</li> <li>ignore - The user is not warned that the browser is unsupported, and the form is displayed.</li> </ul>  Default value: warn Example: <pre><code>ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.detectBrowser=ignore\n</code></pre> disableUseTab  Hides the \"Use\" tab, and prevents fetching the list of deployed and usable applications, where: <ul> <li>true - \"Use\" tab is hidden</li> <li>false - \"Use\" tab is displayed</li> </ul> Default value: false Example: <pre><code>ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.disableUseTab=true\n</code></pre>  EventHandler.infoLevelEvents  EventHandler.debugLevelEvents  EventHandler.auditLevelEvents   Leap contains an event handling implementation that enables printing out all or specific events in the system log or in a separate file based on properties setting, by default this feature is not enabled. Change properties, in the Leap_config.properties file, to monitor events that you are interested in, and where you want to output the event information.  The following will output Events information in Application Server's system log at info or debug level: <ul> <li>EventHandler.infoLevelEvents</li> <li>EventHandler.debugLevelEvents</li> </ul> auditLevelEvents will output to a file. The default file location on Windows is C:\\febEvents.log and AIX/Linux is /febEvents.log, with maximum file size 5MB, back up to 5 files.  The content of the event output is in CSV format, the description of the data: Event topic, Event time stamp, User id, User email, Application uid, Application title, Form id, Record uid, Result  The following is the list of event topics that Leap sends out: <ul> <li>builder/app/delete \u2013 Application is deleted</li><li>builder     <li>builder/app/deploy \u2013 Application is deployed for the first time</li> <li>builder/app/redeploy \u2013 A deployed application is deployed again</li> <li>builder/app/stop \u2013 A deployed application is stopped</li> <li>builder/app/import \u2013 Application is imported</li> <li>builder/app/importAndDeploy \u2013 Application is imported and deployed</li> <li>builder/app/importAndDeployWithData \u2013 Application is imported and deployed with data</li> <li>builder/app/export \u2013 Application is exported</li> <li>builder/app/exportWithData \u2013 Application is exported with data</li> <li>builder/app/upgrade \u2013 Application is upgraded</li> <li>builder/app/upgradeWithDataReplaced \u2013 Application is upgraded and the data replaced</li> <li>builder/app/result/export \u2013 Application data is exported from View Data (or REST API)</li> <li>builder/app/retrieve/source \u2013 Application source is retrieved</li> <li>builder/app/query/deployed \u2013 Application deployment state is queried</li> <li>builder/record/submit \u2013 A record is submitted by normal app usage</li> <li>builder/record/update \u2013 A record is updated by normal app usage</li> <li>builder/record/delete \u2013 A record is deleted by normal app usage</li> <li>builder/data/insert/user \u2013 A record is created as a result of a direct user action</li> <li>builder/data/insert/code \u2013 A record is created indirectly</li> <li>builder/data/update/user \u2013 A record is updated as a result of a direct user action</li> <li>builder/data/update/code \u2013 A record is updated indirectly</li> <li>builder/data/delete/user \u2013 A record is deleted as a result of a direct user action</li> <li>builder/data/delete/code \u2013 A record is deleted indirectly</li>  To capture failed events, use \"builder/error/[EVENT_TOPIC]\" Example: <pre><code> ibm.nitro.EventHandler.infoLevelEvents=builder/record/submit,builder/error/builder/record/submit\n</code></pre> exportDataWithEmails  By default when you export data from applications, emails are also exported. You can exclude emails from the export by changing the property value to false.  Where: <ul> <li>true - emails are exported with application data</li> <li>false - emails are not exported with application data</li> </ul> Default value: true Example: <pre><code>ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.exportDataWithEmails=true\n</code></pre>  imageDomainWhitelist.enabled=true  imageDomainWhitelist.[N].domain   The imageDomainWhitelist config settings define a white-list of domains from where images can be uploaded to a Rich Text Entry field.  In addition to setting the following: imageDomainWhitelist.enabled=true for each domain an additional parameters must be set. imageDomainWhitelist.[N].domain = where \"[N]\" is an integer number identifying that service.  domain - The domain property implicitly allows sub-domains. For example, a domain property of example.com allows URLs such as https://www.example.com/anything, http://api.example.com/anything, or https://example.com/anything. Examples: <pre><code>ibm.nitro.imageDomainWhitelist.enabled=true\nibm.nitro.imageDomainWhitelist.[1].domain=http://acme.com\nibm.nitro.imageDomainWhitelist.[2].domain=http://acme2.com\n</code></pre> InfoEntryPoint.dailyInfo  Provides HTML content that is shown in the login screen. Can be used for status messages, or help.  <pre><code>ibm.nitro.InfoEntryPoint.dailyInfo = Welcome to &lt;b&gt;HCL Leap&lt;/b&gt;\n</code></pre> LogoutServlet.postLogoutRedirectURL  The value of this parameter tells Leap where to redirect user after log off. If the parameter is not configured or left blank, the user is redirected to the login page. Example: <pre><code>ibm.nitro.LogoutServlet.postLogoutRedirectURL=http://example_url.com/signout\n</code></pre>  maximumRecordsToRetrieve  Maximum number of records that are permitted for export from the View Data page at one time. If the number of records to be exported exceeds the number set by this property, the export is stopped, and an error message is shown. Note: The default value of 20,000 is supported for base systems. Setting the value higher could result in poor performance, depending on result set size and server hardware. Example: <pre><code>ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.maximumRecordsToRetrieve=25000\n</code></pre>  MemberManager.adminAlias  MemberManager.userProps.loginName  MemberManager.userProps.id  MemberManager.groupProps.id  MemberManager.userProps.email  MemberManager.userProps.displayName  MemberManager.adminAlias setting is mandatory. For WebSphere Application Server only, configure the VMM login.  By default, Leap uses J2C alias vmmAdmin to authenticate with VMM. You must configure it here if you want to change the J2C alias name.  You must have WebSphere Application Server administrative user credentials to run Leap  If you use LDAP within WebSphere Application Server, there are a number of properties that look up user and group information. If your LDAP uses different property keys than the ones set by default, update the property keys here so that user and group look up function correctly.  If you are using LDAP within WebSphere Application Server, refer to the following settings: MemberManager.userProps.loginName  Describes the LDAP property used as the login ID. Each loginName must be unique.  Default setting: uid MemberManager.userProps.id  Represents a unique key for the user. This key must be identical to the loginName.  Default setting: uid MemberManager.groupProps.id  Represents a unique key for the group. The value is the LDAP property that is used. For example, cn, represents Common Name.  Default setting: cn MemberManager.userProps.email  The email address of the user. Leap uses this email address to send notifications and other emails to the user.  Default setting: mail MemberManager.userProps.displayName  Used to display the name of the user, instead of the login id.  Default setting: cn Examples: <pre><code>ibm.was.MemberManager.userProps.loginName = mail \nibm.was.MemberManager.userProps.id = mail\nibm.was.MemberManager.groupProps.id = name\nibm.was.MemberManager.userProps.email = mail\nibm.was.MemberManager.userProps.displayName = cn\n</code></pre> purgeOrphanFilesHours  In some circumstances, files attached to either application designs or user-submitted records can become orphaned if the primary design or record element is removed outside the normal process. File records which are older than this number of hours and are no longer associated with an existing primary record are removed.  Default value: 48 Example: <pre><code>ibm.nitro.purgeOrphanFilesHours=36\n</code></pre> runtimeCSP  The runtimeCSP setting defines the <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> (CSP) header that will be applied to running Forms. Note: This setting only applies to Forms. It does not currently apply to App Pages, Summary Charts, or the View Data page.  For more information on CSP, see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP  For more information on Strict CSP, see Strict CSP Example: <pre><code>ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.runtimeCSP=default-src 'self' *.example.com; img-src *\n</code></pre> runtimeResources.[N]  Additional web resources to load into the Leap UI for leveraging the Custom Widget API. The values from these settings will be injected into the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of Leap's HTML pages. Example: <pre><code>ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.runtimeResources.1 = &lt;link rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' media='screen' href='/custom-widgets/samples/acme/Acme_Widgets.css'&gt;\nibm.nitro.NitroConfig.runtimeResources.2 = &lt;script type='text/javascript' src='/custom-widgets/samples/acme/Acme_common.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\nibm.nitro.NitroConfig.runtimeResources.3 = &lt;script type='text/javascript' src='/custom-widgets/samples/acme/Acme_Boolean_Widget.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre> secureJS  Enables or disables JavaScript restrictions in run time forms. When a form designer adds custom JavaScript to an application, this flag restricts the scope of that custom JavaScript. This flag applies to the entire Leap server for all users. Note: Setting this parameter to <code>false</code> might expose users to malicious JavaScript. Only set to <code>false</code> in a secured environment where Leap applications are created by trusted users.  For more information, see JavaScript API for Leap.  Default value: true Example: <pre><code>ibm.nitro.ApplicationCompilerService.secureJS = false\n</code></pre>  serviceAuthorization.enabled  serviceAuthorization.[SERVICE_ID]   Access to a service description may be given to a specific user, group, or special assignment. The access control is made up of two parts: <ul> <li>Who may \"discover\" and work with the service while designing an application.</li> <li>Who may \"invoke\" the service.</li> </ul>  Users or Groups provided must be defined using the attributes defined by <code>ibm.was.MemberManager.userProps.id = mail</code> and <code>ibm.was.MemberManager.groupProps.id = name</code> respectively.   Special assignment valid values are:  <ul> <li>all-authenticated: for app author \"discover\" privilege only</li> <li>anonymous: for app authors and end-user \"discover\" and \"invoke\" privileges</li> <li>all-authors: for end-user \"invoke\" privilege only</li> </ul>  To enable service authorizations, set <code>ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.serviceAuthorization.enabled=true</code>. Multiple services may be defined. To define a service authorization, add <code>ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.serviceAuthorization.serviceIdN</code> where serviceIdN is the 'id' of the service description. The value must be a valid JSON string, see provided samples.  Note: A backslash (\\) at the end of a line can be used to present a value over multiple lines. The backslash must be the very last character on the line. Examples: <pre><code>ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.serviceAuthorization.enabled = true\nibm.nitro.NitroConfig.serviceAuthorization.serviceId1 = { \\\n   \"comment\": \"Auth for Service 1\", \\\n   \"discover\": { \"users\": [\"user1\"], \"groups\": [\"group1\"], \"special\": [] }, \\\n   \"invoke\": { \"users\": [], \"groups\": [], \"special\": [\"all-authenticated\"]\" } \\\n}\n</code></pre> serverURI  Indicates the base URI used for critical functions, including editing applications, and email. Must include everything necessary to connect to the Leap context, for example, /apps.  With this entry, all emailed links, and absolute links visible during Leap design time start with the following base URI regardless of what the user enters in the address bar.  Example: <pre><code>ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.serverURI = https://leap.example.com/apps\n</code></pre>  servicesWhitelist.enabled  servicesWhitelist.[N].actions  servicesWhitelist.[N].domain   The servicesWhitelist config settings define a white list of domains and HTTP actions that app authors are allowed to call directly from their applications using URL based services.  In addition to setting <code>servicesWhitelist.enabled=true</code>, for each service two additional parameters must be set: <ul> <li>servicesWhitelist.[N].domain =</li> <li>servicesWhitelist.[N].actions =</li> </ul> The domain property implicitly allows sub-domains. For example, a domain property of example.com allows URLs such as https://www.example.com/anything, http://api.example.com/anything, or https://example.com/anything.  The https or http protocol included in the domain property is respected. For example, a domain property of https://api.example.com only allows calls to secure SSL https://api.example.com/anything and not to non-secure http://api.example.com/anything.  The actions property is a comma-separated list of the HTTP actions allowed for a particular domain. Valid values are GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, HEAD, and PATCH. If the actions value is missing, no actions are allowed.  Where [N] is an integer number identifying that service.  Default value: true Examples: <pre><code>ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.servicesWhitelist.enabled = true\nibm.nitro.NitroConfig.servicesWhitelist.1.domain = example.com\nibm.nitro.NitroConfig.servicesWhitelist.1.actions = GET\nibm.nitro.NitroConfig.servicesWhitelist.2.domain = https://securehost.com\nibm.nitro.NitroConfig.servicesWhitelist.2.actions = GET, POST,PUT\n</code></pre> Note: This white-list has no effect on service descriptions and custom service transports that were installed on the server by the administrator.  SetupAll.setupStatus  After deploying Leap for the first time or upgrading to a newer version, there is a setup screen that is presented upon accessing the manage page. This setup screen shows the status of detecting and updating the database tables, checks that security is properly enabled, and a mail session is configured. This page requires the admin to click a button to fully progress through the setup.  To disable this setup page and required admin interaction add the property:  <pre><code>ibm.nitro.SetupAll.setupStatus = start\n</code></pre> viewResponsesMaximumCount  For DB2\u00ae or Oracle. The maximum number of records that are counted when returning record sets in pages. If the total number of records exceeds viewResponsesMaximumCount, then paging indicators will no longer accurately lists the total number of pages. Setting this value higher can have performance consequences for the server if there are many users viewing forms with large response lists.  Default value: 1000 Example: <pre><code>ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.viewResponsesMaximumCount=2000\n</code></pre> xFrameOptions  Use this setting to control the <code>X-Frame-Options</code> response header for Leap pages, which determines if Leap can be embedded into other web pages.

The code might look something like this:</p> <pre><code>if(pActionId === 'S_Submit') {\n// do your custom validation, here you can use setValid() or setRequired() if desired\n// if you consider the form to be in an invalid state then return false to cancel the submit action\nif(!app.getSharedData().isFormValid) {\nreturn false;\n}\n}\n</code></pre> <p>This technique looks to cancel the submit action if the form is deemed invalid by your criteria.

The Services Architecture consists of the following components:</p> <ul> <li>Service Transports \u2013 The Service Transport is the Java\u2122 code responsible for communicating with an external service, such as a public REST service. It can send data out to the external service or receive data from the external service. The transport also uses JDBC to store and retrieve data from any database. Alternatively, the transport can simply implement a \u201cservice\u201d itself, such as a unit conversion library. You can add any custom transport installation to the Leap installation by placing an appropriate JAR file in a specific directory on the Leap server; however, Leap already includes a generic HTTP transport which can send and receive data over the internet or intranet, and will suffice for many use cases. For more information, see Service Description.</li> <li>Service Descriptions \u2013 The Service Description provides the interface for a Service Transport. A Service Description is usually described by an XML file, although it is also possible to programmatically create a Service Description. The Service Description specifies a service's name, description, input parameters, and output parameters. These attributes are what appear to the application designer when they are hooking up services to a Leap application.</li> <li>Data Mapping \u2013 Each service description can contain an optional \u201cmapping\u201d component which describes how the data coming from the Service Transport can be mapped to the outputs defined in the Service Description, or vice versa. The advantage of the mapping component is that it allows multiple Service Descriptions, each with its own name, description, input, and outputs to use to use the same generic transport. By using XPath-like references, the mapping component supports the mapping of complex data structures such as an XML document. The mapping of constant values is also supported.</li> <li>Service Configuration \u2013 The Service Configuration is another layer of mapping meant for application designers. It maps items in the form to the inputs and outputs of the Service Description. The application designer is responsible for creating service configurations and connecting form items to the service inputs and outputs. Service configurations are stored inside the application.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"cr_using_apps_exposing_service_to.html#supporting-documents","title":"Supporting documents","text":"<p>Use the following documents to gain a better understanding of the steps required to expose a service to Leap.</p> <p>Understanding the HTTP transport \u2013 The HTTP Service Transport provides a mechanism to communicate with HTTP servers. The transport allows configuration of the URL to request, HTTP method to use, query parameters, and request headers. When combined with the service mapping engine of Leap, the HTTP Service Transport can extract data from an HTTP response and make it available to your application. The HTTP Service Transport can be used to communicate with any standard HTTP server. While there are some limits on the capabilities of the HTTP Service Transport, it is all that is needed to communicate with a basic HTTP server, or RESTful service, in most cases. For more information, see HTTP Service Transport</p> <p>Creating and deploying service descriptions \u2013 The Service Description provides an interface to Leap mapping interface, and an interface to a Service Transport.

Or, you can search a list of products that are maintained by another application. The ability to share data is a powerful feature of Leap.</p> <p>To use an application as a service, the designer of an application must set the requisite permissions on the Access tab of the application. Access can be set for Read, or Read/Write. If you set Read access, other applications are able to Retrieve and Search information from a specific application. If you set Read/Write access, other applications are able to Retrieve, Search, Delete, and Submit information to and from a specific application. For more information about setting permissions, see Defining permissions to share data with other applications.</p> <p>Note: When you use another Leap application as a service, mandatory items must be explicitly mapped in the service mapping Inputs and Outputs. Default Items in the form do not satisfy the mandatory requirement as they are not evaluated on the server. If any value is marked as mandatory, it must have a value that is mapped to it in the mappings dialog.</p> <p>When mapping input parameters, each target has a Search Operator that can change how the inputs are interpreted. For example, you can apply a search operator to create an assignment that links the input with the target, and the operator. To apply the operator, you have to set the View to constant and then type the operator keyword in the editable field. The following table contains the list of available search operators.</p> Search Operators Description equals Equal to notequals Not equal to lt Less than lte Less than or equal to gt Greater than gte Greater than or equal to Endswith The target ends with Startswith The target starts with contains The target contains <p>The services also provide access to metadata about the records, such as author, creation time, and the current stage. When you call these services, metadata can be used to filter the results.</p> <p>The search results can be sorted by form data, such as a field in an application, or by some metadata, such as the lastUpdated time. The default sort order is ascending. To change it to descending, you must prefix your sort field with \u201cDESC\u201d. For example, the following string sorts ascending, <code>\"F_Name\"</code>. The following string sorts descending, <code>\"DESCF_Name\"</code>.</p> <p>The following values are available for you to use when you are searching with metadata:</p> Metadata field Sort key Last update time <code>\"lastUpdated\"</code> Author name <code>\"itemAuthor\"</code> Stage name <code>\"flowState\"</code> Line ID <code>\"dbId\"</code> <p>You can also limit the results by setting a Page Size that limits how many entries you return, or a Page, which limits pages to return. If you do not provide paging values, then all records that meet your filters are returned.</p> <p>To see the list of applications available as services select the HCL Leap Applications entry in the Service Catalog list. A list of all applications and methods available for Service mapping is shown. Each application can expose the following methods that are based on Access settings:</p> <p>Retrieve :   Use Retrieve retrieve a single record from another application. For example, use Retrieve to pre-populate information that is based on an employee serial number that is entered by the user into the form. The retrieve returns a single row, and cannot be mapped to a repeating or list item.</p> <p>Search :   Use Search to return a list of records from another application that meets the search criteria. For example, use Search to populate a drop-down with a list of values from another Leap application. The results from a search must be mapped to a repeating/list, drop-down, or table item.</p> <p>Delete :   When Delete service method is called, it deletes the record in the target application that meets the supplied parameters. Use this method with caution as there is no way to retrieve the data after the record is deleted.</p> <p>Create :   The Create method is used to create a record in the target application. Create replicates a user interacting with, and submitting, the target form.</p> <p>Update :   The\u00a0Update\u00a0method is used to update an existing record in the target application.\u00a0Update\u00a0replicates a user interacting with, and submitting changes to a record in the target form</p> <p>Parent topic: Incorporating web services into your applications</p>"},{"location":"cr_using_the_editor_toc.html","title":"Using the Editor","text":"<p>This topic provides details on using the Leap Editor.</p>"},{"location":"cr_using_the_editor_toc.html#editor-overview","title":"Editor Overview","text":"<ol> <li>Navigation breadcrumb.

Forms are a single page, or collection of pages, that create the user interface with which people interact.

Applications gather the submitted input and automatically store the submissions in a database.</p>"},{"location":"get_overview.html#building-forms","title":"Building forms","text":"<p>When you start Leap, you are shown a screen with two tabs on the Forms toolbar: Use and Manage. The Use tab shows a list of all applications that are created by other users to which you have access. The Manage tab is where you create and manage applications. When Leap opens, you are shown the Manage tab, which displays any applications you created, or for which you have edit permissions.</p> <p>To create an application, click New Application, enter a descriptive application name, and select Create. A blank form is displayed.</p> <p>Drag items from the Palette and drop them onto the form. As you add items, you can change the default name of each item directly on the form. Click the name of the widget on the canvas to edit the name.</p> <p>A built-in grid automatically aligns items on the form, and expands vertically when you add items to the form. The default layout is two columns and two rows. However, you have flexibility when you build your form. You can stretch one form item to span across all columns, and you can add and delete columns and rows as needed. Click any border of a column or row to access a menu with options for expanding or contracting your form.</p> <p>When you click the Rules icon, you can create rules for form items or for other objects. You can set a rule to show or hide a form item, page, or other object that is based on user input.</p> <p>Some form items must be edited by changing their properties. For example, you can add the survey questions on the form, but the question titles can be edited only in the properties panel.</p> <p>When an item is selected the properties panel appears on the side of the screen. There are many tabs within the properties panel where you can set various functions. For example:</p> <p>Properties tab :   Edit properties such as whether the title of a form item appears on the form. The properties that are displayed vary based on the form item.</p> <p>Event tab :   Define an event that happens based on user input, such as when the user selects a particular option.</p> <p>Formula tab :   Create mathematical expressions to calculate field values and validate form data.</p>"},{"location":"get_overview.html#adding-workflow-elements-to-a-form","title":"Adding workflow elements to a form","text":"<p>There are many cases where adding separate steps and restricting user access to part of a form makes the form more useful. For example, you can create a vacation request form that requires the approval of a supervisor, or an award nomination form that requires the approval of both a supervisor and a nomination committee. In the survey form example, the results from the survey are useful feedback, but by adding workflow elements, the curriculum supervisor can review comments before sending them to the instructor. Adding workflow elements is done with Roles and Stages.</p> <p>Adding or editing Roles is done in the Access or Workflow tab. Adding stages is done in the Workflow tab.</p> <p>Roles \u2013 You can create various roles with different levels of access to different information within an application. For example, you can specify that only an administrator can change an application, managers can review submitted data, and users can complete and submit the form. After roles are defined, you can assign users to the roles. Each role can have as many or as few people assigned to it as needed. You can even assign groups to a role. For example, all supervisors are assigned to one role, and all managers are assigned to another role.</p> <p>In the Access tab, each role can either be Open or Closed. If you have a web service, which pre-populates the role information, select Open. For example, you want to use a web service to scan the company email directory and automatically populate the name of the manager. If you do not plan to use web services in your application, leave the role Closed. The user must enter the name of the manager manually when they complete the form.</p> <p>Stages \u2013 Stages are the steps that a form goes through in its lifecycle. For example, in one stage the user submits data. In the next stage, the manager reviews and approves or rejects the submitted data. An application can have as many stages as needed. Stages are also useful as they allow a submitter to save a draft version of the form. For example, on a census form that has multiple pages, the submitter might not have time to complete the whole form in one session. With the Draft button, the user can complete part of the census, save a draft, then return to complete the census later. A stage can hide or display information that is necessary for one user, but not required for another. For example, in our survey form, the curriculum supervisor must see the name of who submitted the feedback. However, to allow for anonymous feedback, the user's name is hidden when the feedback is forwarded from the curriculum supervisor to the course instructor.</p> <p>By default, every form has a Start and Submitted stage. The Start stage is the first stage of every form. The Submitted stage can be modified and other stages added.</p> <p>To create a workflow, add stages in the Workflow tab. You may hover over the stage and click the plus icon, or click on \u201c+ Add Stage\u201d in the properties pane.</p> <p></p> <p>When a new stage is added, you can modify its properties to build the form workflow as needed. For example, you can add a stage to a survey that thanks the user for submitting feedback and sends the curriculum supervisor an email that indicates that new feedback is available. After the feedback is reviewed by the supervisor, another stage can be added to block the user's name and company information and then forward the feedback to the course instructor.</p> <p>At any time during the form building process, you can save and preview your work in a web browser by clicking Preview.</p> <p></p> <p>Ensure that your browser does not block pop-up windows because the preview form opens in a new window. The Submit and Cancel buttons are automatically added to your form, and are displayed when you preview the form.</p>"},{"location":"get_overview.html#deploying-your-application","title":"Deploying your application","text":"<p>When you complete building your form and adding workflow elements, you must deploy your application to make it available to users.

The View Data screen displays all submitted responses in a table. You can sort the submitted results by clicking any of the column titles. Selecting a response displays the submitted data in a new window.</p> <p>Forms that have extra stages have extra buttons in the View Data screen. For example, the curriculum supervisor has a button to accept the feedback, which forwards the feedback to the course instructor. In another example, such as a vacation request form, the manager can either accept or reject the vacation request. If the manager accepts the request, the request is forwarded to Human Resources to log against the available vacation days.

This is important for forms that might be shown within the context of another web page, such as in the IBM\u00ae WebSphere\u00ae Portal environment.</li> <li>Base your CSS rules around class names that are prefixed with \u201clf\u201d. For example: lfFormFieldSingleLine. These class names that are likely to remain consistent between Leap releases.</li> <li>Your custom styles are not restricted, so you must be specific with your selectors. Selectors that are too broad affect all aspects of theLeap interface, including all dialogs and all elements within the View Data interface.</li> <li>Your CSS must target the browsers that are supported by Leap.</li> <li>If possible, avoid CSS rules that affect the size and positioning of elements. You might want to specify some custom padding and margins, but it is your responsibility to ensure that no erroneous cropping or extra scroll-bars are displayed. We recommend that you limit your theme to the following properties:<ul> <li>background color</li> <li>background image \u2013 typically for background gradients</li> <li>color</li> <li>font</li> <li>font size</li> <li>border \u2013 typically none or one pixel width</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"ref_customized_css.html#styling-individual-form-items","title":"Styling individual form items","text":"<p>Each item on the form is assigned a unique class name.

You can then use the custom CSS class names in your custom theme. Setting custom CSS class names is done in the Properties side panel. Specify the custom class names, which are separated by spaces, in the Custom CSS class names field. Custom class names can also be added to, or removed from, items dynamically with the JavaScript\u2122 API.</p>"},{"location":"ref_customized_css.html#testing-your-custom-css-changes","title":"Testing your custom CSS changes","text":"<p>Use a CSS development tool to test your custom CSS changes. Most web browsers contain such a tool, which you can use to discover the wanted styling class.

After the rules are determined, copy them to your custom CSS file for uploading into your Leap application.</p> <p>If you do not have access to a CSS development tool, an alternative approach is to place the CSS file on a web server. Reference the web location when you add the CSS file to your Leap application. You can modify the CSS file on the web server, then refresh the Leap application to pick up the changes. This approach quickly tests style changes without requiring you to repeatedly upload a new CSS file into your application, save the application, and then redeploy.</p> <p>Parent topic: Reference</p>"},{"location":"ref_data_access_rest_api.html","title":"Data access REST API","text":"<p>The data access REST API exposes operations on application submitted data, also known as records.</p> <p>The data captured by an HCL Leap application is stored in a relational database.

There are some limits on what the HTTP Service Transport can provide, but in most cases, the HTTP Service Transport is all that is required to communicate with a basic HTTP server, or RESTful service.</p>"},{"location":"ref_service_http_service_transport.html#how-to-use-the-http-service-transport","title":"How to use the HTTP Service Transport","text":"<p>The HTTP Service Transport has numerous parameters to configure it to talk to many HTTP Servers. In many cases, only a subset of the available parameters is needed. However, all the parameters can be used for any Service Description. The following sections provide a high-level outline of the parameters needed to configure specific parts of your HTTP request.</p> <p>Configuring the Request Method</p> <p>All HTTP requests require a request method, which tells the receiving HTTP server what to do with the request. </p> <p>The HTTP Service Transport supports all the basic HTTP request methods, including: GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE. The HTTP Service Transport supports configuring the HTTP request method with the request-method parameter. If this parameter is missing, or does not contain a valid HTTP request method, then the default, GET is used.</p> <p>Configuring the Request URL</p> <p>A URL is required to make an HTTP request. There is no default for this parameter, so it must be provided to the HTTP Service Transport. There are several parameters that affect how the request URL is built: request-url, request-url-postfix, request-url-postfix-encoded, and two dynamic parameters: request-url-postfix-N and request-url-postfix-N-encoded. </p> <p>The HTTP Service Transport constructs the URL by starting with the value of request-url and appending postfixes. If request-url-postfix is present, its value is appended to the value of request-url. Before appending, the HTTP Service Transport URL encodes the value of request-url-postfix if the request-url-postfix-encoded flag is not present or if its value is anything other than true. Encoding allows values containing characters that are not valid to be placed into the URL without any harm. Choosing to not encode a value allows it to be appended without modification to the URL. </p> <p>For example, consider a Service Description that requires the path to a file as input. Since the path might contain slash (/) characters that must be preserved, then request-url-postfix-encoded is set to true. This instructs the HTTP Service Transport to leave the value alone. However, another Service Description might need to include a text string as a path component. In this case, the slash (/) or any other characters are encoded such that they do not interfere with the path. In this second case, the request-url-postfix-encoded parameter is set to false or omitted from the Service Description. </p> <p>In some cases, having a single postfix does not provide enough flexibility. Therefore, the dynamic parameters request-url-postfix-Nand request-url-postfix-N-encoded are used. The N in each of these parameters refers to its order. During processing, the HTTP Service Transport appends the value of these parameters starting with 0 until it finds a missing parameter. As with the single postfix, encoding is optionally performed on each of the parameters before it is added if the value of the request-url-postfix-N-encoded flag is not present or contains any value other than true. </p> <p>For example, if the Service Description contains parameters called request-url-postfix-0, request-url-postfix-1, and request-url-postfix-3, only request-url-postfix-0 and request-url-postfix-1 are appended to the URL.  While building the request URL if a parameter called request-url-postfix is found, the dynamic parameters are ignored. The Service Description developer must make a conscious choice to use these dynamic parameters.</p> <p>Configuring Request Parameters</p> <p>Query parameters are configured using parameters with the prefix request-query-. Text after the prefix is considered to be the name of the query parameter to pass. The value of the query parameter comes from the value of the transport parameter, and is encoded to prevent the URL from being disrupted. All parameters with the request-query- prefix are added to the URL. No guarantees are made as to the order in which the query parameters are added. For example, consider a search service that requires the search criteria term to be passed as a query parameter. In order to communicate with this service, the Service Description must have a parameter called request-query-term.</p> <p>Configuring Request Headers</p> <p>The HTTP Service Transport allows HTTP request headers to be configured using parameters with the prefix request-header-. Text after the prefix is considered to be the name of the header. The value of the request header is the value of the parameter. No escaping or encoding is performed on either the name or value of request headers. Therefore, header configuration must include only characters that are permissible.</p> <p>Configuring the Request Body</p> <p>HTTP allows a body, or entity, to be sent with PUT and POST requests. In order to allow a Service Description to include a request entity, the HTTP Service Transport sends the contents of the request-entity parameter with the request. The contents of this parameter are ignored if the content of request-method is not PUT or POST.</p> <p>Configuring HTTP Authentication</p> <p>The HTTP Service Transport supports HTTP Basic and HTTP Digest authentication schemes. There arethreetwo mechanisms through which the credentials can be configured: hard coded in the Service Description, provided through the Java 2 Connector (J2C) Authentication Credentials provider, or provided at run time through the Basic Credentials Provider. </p> <p>To hard code the credentials that the HTTP Service Transport uses to authenticate, the request-http-auth-username and request-http-auth-password parameters must be available. The values of these parameters are used during any HTTP authentication challenge for either HTTP Basic or HTTP Digest authentication. The HTTP Service Transport performs any hashing required. Therefore, the values of these parameters must be the plain text version of both the user name and password. </p> <p>Credentials can be provided at run time using the Basic Credentials Provider. Refer to the Service Description and Basic Credentials Provider help topic for more information. The HTTP Service Transport only uses credentials provided by the Basic Credentials Provider if the request-http-auth-username and request-http-auth-password parameters are empty. </p> <p>Credentials can be provided using the J2C Authentication Credentials Provider. Refer to the Java 2 Connector (J2C) Authentication Credentials Provider help topic for more information. </p> <p>Note: The HTTP Service transport can only use credentials provided by the Basic Credentials provideror the J2C Authentication Credentials Provider if the request-HTTP-auth-username and request-HTTP-auth-password parameters are empty. </p> <p>In addition to HTTP Basic and HTTP Digest authentication, the HTTP Service Transport supports Single Sign on (SSO) authentication using the Cookie Credentials Provider. In the case where the request made through the HTTP Service Transports needs to passLeap authentication cookies, the Cookie Credentials Provider can be used. In general, the Cookie Credentials Provider is configured to pass the LtpaToken and LtpaToken2 cookies. Consult the Service Description and Cookie Credentials Provider help topics for information.</p> <p>Receiving Response Status Information</p> <p>The HTTP Service Transport ensures that the HTTP status code and message are available for consumption. The HTTP status code, for example, 200, 404, or 500, is available in the outbound response-code parameter. Similarly, the outbound response-message parameter contains the status message returned, for example, OK, Not Found, or Server Error.</p> <p>Receiving Response Headers</p> <p>All the headers that are returned in the HTTP response are made available to the Service Description via dynamic parameters. Each header name is converted to lowercase and appended with response-header-. For example, the content-type header would be available as an outbound parameter called response-header-content-type. The parameter contains the value of the header. In the case where a header contains more than one value, the header values are collapsed into a single comma-separated list.</p> <p>Receiving the Response Body</p> <p>The entire response body, or entity, is made available via the outbound response-entity parameter.</p>"},{"location":"ref_service_http_service_transport.html#specifying-the-http-service-transport-in-a-service-description","title":"Specifying the HTTP Service Transport in a Service Description","text":"<p>The HTTP Service Transport can be used by specifying its unique ID as the value of the transportId element of the Service Description.

The mapping elements within a Service Description instruct Leap on how to produce one such structure from another, potentially extracting values from strings treated as XML or JSON.</p>"},{"location":"ref_service_mapping_service_description.html#mapping-definition","title":"Mapping Definition","text":"<p>Each mapping element within a Service Description describes how Leap must map data from a source to a destination. Each mapping is made up of a source, and a target. The value of the source and target attributes is a colon separated value containing the scheme of the value and its name. Valid values for the scheme depend on the binding in which the mapping is located, and whether the scheme refers to the source or target of the mapping. For inbound mapping, the source scheme must be parameter or constant, and the target must be transport. For outbound mapping, the source scheme must be transport or constant, and the target must be parameter. A summary of the valid schemes and their contexts are listed in Table 1. The name component of a scheme identifies the key to use when looking up a value or where to place the result.</p> <p>Table 1.

Both ends of a mapping can contain a reference, which allows a subset of the source to be placed at a specific location within the target. Valid values for type are string, xml, json and list, with string being the default. If the type is xml or json, the reference represents an XPath expression that determines which nodes are affected by the mapping. A source reference is used to extract a subset of the value identified by the source scheme. A target reference is used to construct the path where the value extracted from the source is placed. If there are no nodes that match a target reference, the node and its missing parent nodes are created. For this reason, only simple XPath predicates, those that use only the and operator, are permitted. In all other cases, the value of the reference is not used and is omitted. </p> <p>Each mapping element can also contain sub-mappings, which allow repeating structures to be iterated over and built.

If the scheme is constant, the identified constant is looked up and returned. If there is no constant with the given name, an empty string is used. If the scheme is parameter or transport, then the current context is searched for the named item. For top-level mapping elements, this is the root of the parameter structure. For child mapping elements, this is the result of the lookup, conversion, and resolve operation on its parent. If the named value cannot be found in the current context, the parent context is checked until there are no more parent contexts. If the value does not exist in any context, an empty string is used.</p> <p>The value returned by the lookup operation is then converted into the type specified for the source or target. If the conversion produced an XML or JSON value, the reference is resolved, which returns a subset of the original value.</p> <p>The same lookup, conversion, and resolve operations are then performed on the target of the mapping. Once both the source and target are resolved, the mapping operation begins. Generally, the cardinality of the target matches the source. For example, if a list is the source, then the target must be a list. Similarly, if a single value is the source, then the target must be a single value.</p> <p>When the source is a single value, that value is assigned directly to the target value. When the source is a list, a new list is created to contain the results. For each item in the source list, the child mappings of the current mapping element are evaluated. The results of these mappings are added to the list being constructed. When all the source items are evaluated, the list is assigned to the target value.</p> <p>For more information on creating a Service Description that returns JSON, see the Leap wiki.</p> <p>Parent topic: Service Description</p>"},{"location":"ref_service_service_description.html","title":"Service Description","text":"<p>A Service Description provides a specific interface to a Service Transport.

This single XML document contains all the information for a single Service Description: name, description, input and output parameters, and input and output mapping. For a full listing of the XML schema, refer to Appendix A - Service Description schema. The top-level element in a Service Description is the serviceDescription element. This element, and all of its childs, must be in the XML namespace with a URI of http://www.ibm.com/xmlns/prod/forms/services/serviceDescription/1.0.</p> <p>ID</p> <p>Each Service Description must contain a unique id that identifies it to the Leap server. The id can contain any characters that are valid as a component of a URL path. These characters include:</p> <ul> <li>Alphabetical letters \u2013 [A-Z], and [a-z]<ul> <li>Numerals \u2013 [0-9]</li> <li>Hyphens \u2013 [-]</li> <li>Underscore \u2013 [_]</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Because a Service Description ID is a surrogate for the Service Description itself, this ID does not must be descriptive. Any UUID is a valid choice for a Service Description ID because it guarantees uniqueness and contains only characters that are valid in a URL path component.</p> <p>Transport ID</p> <p>A Service Description must reference a Service Transport to perform its underlying operation. Each Service Transport has its own unique transportId that uniquely identifies it to the Leap server. The ID for a Service Transport must be made available by its developer.</p> <p>Name and Description</p> <p>To help users build Leap applications with services, each Service Description contains both a name, and a description. The name and description elements allow you to localize a Leap Service Description in multiple languages using duplicate elements, each with a different xml:lang attribute and contents.See Localizing Service Descriptions for information about how to provide names and descriptions in multiple languages.</p> <p>Default Locale</p> <p>If the Service Description is not localized in the language of a particular user, the defaultLocale contains the locale in which the name and description must be presented. For example, if a user asks for the Service Description in French, but the Service Description has only English and Spanish strings, the English is returned if en is set as the defaultLocale.</p> <p>Credentials</p> <p>The credentials contains the configuration for a Credentials Provider. The ID of the credentials provider is specified in the providerId attribute. The credentials element can contain zero or more property elements to configure the properties of the specified Credentials Provider. </p> <p>Each property element must contain a name attribute whose value is the name of the property being configured, and a value attribute that contains the value of the property. Not all Credentials Providers are applicable to all Service Transports. Therefore, the documentation for each Service Transport must be consulted before you configure the credentials element. If the configured Service Transport does not understand the provider that is specified by providerId, the Service Description is not available.</p> <p>Bindings</p> <p>Every Service Description must specify its input and output structures. These structures outline the ID, name, description, and type of each parameter and any subparameters. In addition to the parameter structure, bindings might also contain a section that declares how data going into the Service Transport is mapped from the input structure and how data coming from the Service Transport is mapped to the output structure.</p> <p>There are two top-level elements for bindings: inbound, and outbound. Inbound defines the binding for data coming into the Service Description from the Builder Application. Outbound defines the data going to the Leap application from the Service Description. Only one of each of these elements can be present within a single Service Description, and each must be placed as a child of the serviceDescription element.</p> <p>Directly underneath inbound and outbound are two elements that define the main components of a binding: parameters and serviceMapping. The parameters element contains all the information that is related to the parameters. The contents of the serviceMapping element instructs Leap how to map data coming from the parameters into data for the transport and vice versa.</p> <p>Parameters</p> <p>The parameters element contains zero or more parameter elements. Each parameter element defines a single parameter coming into or being returned from the Service Description. Each parameter element must have an id, type, name, and description. The id element uniquely identifies the parameter within the binding. The type element specifies the type of data that is expected to be contained within the parameter. The following data types are supported: STRING, BOOLEAN, DECIMAL, FLOAT, DOUBLE, INTEGER, DATETIME, TIME, DATE, and LIST.</p> <p>As with the name and description child elements of the serviceDescription element, these childs of parameter specify the name and description of the parameter that is used in Leap. These elements can also be localized using the xml:lang attribute.</p> <p>Optionally, the mandatory element can be included for inbound bindings to specify whether the parameter must be bound before starting the Service Description. Valid values for this element are true and false, with the latter being the default.</p> <p>Each parameter element can have a child element that is called parameters which is a container for child parameters. The contents of the parameters element is one or more parameter elements. If a parameter contains subparameters, its type is set to LIST.

The serviceDescription element contains all the information that is needed for the Leap server to work with the Service Description. The unique ID of this Service Description is get-content-type as defined in line 3. The unique ID is not exposed to a user, but it must be unique.  Line 5 declares the ID of the Service Transport to use, which is HTTPServiceTransport, and this is the unique ID of the HTTP Service Transport. Lines 7 and 8 define the name and description of the Service Description, which are presented to the user when designing applications.</p> <p>Lines 10-20 define the inbound bindings, and lines 21-30 define the outbound bindings. As mentioned previously, the inbound bindings refer to the parameters that are flowing from the application to the Service Transport. The outbound bindings refer to the parameters that are flowing in the opposite direction.</p> <p>Lines 11-19 contain all the inbound parameters, of which there is only one.  The parameter that is defined in lines 12-18 represents the URL to which a request is made. According to the HTTP Service Transport documentation, the parameter that contains the URL to which the request is made must be called request-url.</p> <p>Line 13 defines the id of the parameter so that it matches the expectations of the HTTP Service Transport.</p> <p>The name and description are defined in lines 15 and 16, and line 17 specifies that this parameter must be supplied in order for this Service Description to operate.</p> <p>Lines 21-30 define the outbound parameters for the Service Description. In this case, there is only one output parameter: the content type of the response. The HTTP Service Transport dynamically creates new parameters that are based on the information that is returned in the HTTP response. In particular, response headers are converted to lowercase and are prefixed with response-header-. Since this Service Description is interested in the Content-Type header, the outbound parameter response-header-content-type is created in lines 23-28 to contain this data.</p> <p>Example 2: Augmenting Parameters with Constants</p> <p>The following Service Description returns the same information as Example 1.

However, this Service Description differs from the Example 1 because there are no input parameters to this service. The request-url HTTP Service Transport parameter is mapped into the transport via a constant.</p> <p>Lines 12-17 define the constants section. There is a single constant that is defined in lines 13-16. This constant has an id of url-to-request specified in line 14, and a value of http://www.ibm.com, specified in line 15. The id of the constant is used when creating the parameter structure that is passed to the Service Transport. This constant is referenced in line 19 within the mapping section.</p> <p>Lines 18-20 contain the mapping information. Since there is only one parameter to be sent, there is only one mapping, which is defined in line 19. This mapping specifies that the value of the Service Transport parameter named request-url is specified by the value of the constant named url-to-request.</p> <p>Example 3: Lists of Data</p> <p>The following Service Description demonstrates the use of nested parameters. This example is the same as the Service Description used for the Countries by Region service that is shipped with Leap. This example describes how to specify a region and return a list of the names of countries within that region.</p> <pre><code>1: &lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;\n2: &lt;serviceDescription&gt;\n3:   &lt;id&gt;countries-by-region&lt;/id&gt;\n4:   &lt;defaultLocale&gt;en-us&lt;/defaultLocale&gt;\n5:   &lt;transportId&gt;4647b8cf-093f-11e0-89dd-001e4cf83606&lt;/transportId&gt;\n6:   &lt;name xml:lang=\"en-us\"&gt;\n7:  Countries by Region using Service Description\n8:   &lt;/name&gt;\n9:   &lt;description xml:lang=\"en-us\"&gt;\n10:     Given a region, return a list of country information in that region.\n11:   &lt;/description&gt;\n12:   &lt;inbound&gt;\n13:     &lt;parameters&gt;\n14:       &lt;parameter&gt;\n15:         &lt;id&gt;region&lt;/id&gt;\n16:         &lt;type&gt;STRING&lt;/type&gt;\n17:         &lt;name xml:lang=\"en-us\"&gt;Region&lt;/name&gt;\n18:         &lt;description xml:lang=\"en-us\"&gt;\n19:           One of \"Africa\", \"America, North\", \"America, South\", \"Asia\", \"Europe\", or \"Oceania\"\n20:         &lt;/description&gt;\n21:         &lt;mandatory&gt;true&lt;/mandatory&gt;\n22:       &lt;/parameter&gt;\n23:     &lt;/parameters&gt;\n24:   &lt;/inbound&gt;\n25:   &lt;outbound&gt;\n26:     &lt;parameters&gt;\n27:       &lt;parameter&gt;\n28:         &lt;id&gt;countries&lt;/id&gt;\n29:         &lt;type&gt;LIST&lt;/type&gt;\n30:         &lt;name xml:lang=\"en-us\"&gt;Countries\"&lt;/name&gt;\n31:         &lt;description xml:lang=\"en-us\"&gt;List of country information&lt;/description&gt;\n32:         &lt;parameters&gt;\n33:           &lt;parameter&gt;\n34:             &lt;id&gt;name&lt;/id&gt;\n35:             &lt;type&gt;STRING&lt;/type&gt;\n36:             &lt;name xml:lang=\"en-us\"&gt;Name&lt;/name&gt;\n37:             &lt;description xml:lang=\"en-us\"&gt;Name of Country&lt;/description&gt;\n38:           &lt;/parameter&gt;\n39:         &lt;/parameters&gt;\n40:       &lt;/parameter&gt;\n41:     &lt;/parameters&gt;\n42:   &lt;/outbound&gt;\n43: &lt;/serviceDescription&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>As with the other Service Description examples, this Service Description has its own unique ID, defined in line 3, a name, which is defined in lines 6-8, and a description, which is defined in lines 9-11. This Service Description uses the sample Countries by Region Service Transport, which is shipped with the Leap , and is identified by its id in line 5.</p> <p>Because this Service Description has a single inbound parameter, the parameters element, in lines 13-23, of the inbound bindings in lines 12-24. parameters contains only a single parameter, which is defined in lines 14-22. The id of this parameter is region, which is what is expected by the Countries by Region Service Transport.</p> <p>Since there can be multiple countries within a region, the outbound bindings, which are defined in lines 25-42, must contain a list parameter to contain all the information for each country. The outbound structure for this Service Description consists of a parameter that is called countries that contains a list of maps. Each of the maps that are contained within the countries list consists of a single name key that contains the name of a country. This structure is defined within the parameters element, which is defined in lines 26-41, of the outbound bindings section. The top-level parameter, countries, is defined between lines 27 and 40. Since the countries parameter contains other parameters, its type is set as LIST in line 29. All the parameters of the list entries are defined within the parameters element inside the countries parameter that is defined in lines 32-39. The single name subparameter is defined in lines 33-38.</p> <p>Since the inbound and outbound bindings directly match what is returned by the Countries by Region Service Transport, there is no need for any mapping information. This service can be set up such that the name subparameter is mapped to list-like items such as drop-down options or an item in a table.</p> <p>Example 4: Mapping XML into Parameters</p> <p>The

As with the other Service Description examples, the standard prologue of id, transportId, name, and description is specified in lines 3-7. This service has a single parameter, address, that can be assigned by an application, as specified in lines 10-16. Since this parameter is required to perform the address look-up, it is marked as mandatory in line 15.</p> <p>Since this Service Description uses the HTTP Service Transport, a request-url must be specified. The URL used in this request takes the form http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/xml?address=[address]&amp;sensor=[true|false]. Because there are query parameters that must be sent, this Service Description uses the HTTP Service Transport support for query parameters by prefixing the name of the parameter with request-query-. However, because some of these query parameters are not exposed to the user, you must create a mapping section to map some constant values. The inbound binding constant section, in lines 19-32, defines the three constants that are used: request-url, lines 20-23, false-constant, lines 24-27, and request-method, lines 28-31. These constants contain the URL to which to request is made, a constant string value false for the sensor query parameter, and the request method. While some of these constants, including request-url and request-method, match the name of the parameter to which they are applied, there is no requirement that they match. Parameter names that match do not automatically get a constant value if it has the same name. All mapping must be explicitly defined.</p> <p>In lines 33-38, the mapping section of the inbound binding maps the constants and Service Description parameters to the Service Transport parameters. Each of the mapping elements is fairly self-explanatory: the request-url constant is mapped to the request-url transport parameter; the request-method constant is mapped to the request-method transport parameter; the address parameter is mapped to the request-query-address transport parameter; and the constant false-constant is mapped to the sensor transport parameter.</p> <p>The HTTP Service Transport then builds a URL out of the request-url, request-query-address, and request-query-sensor parameters, and makes a request to that URL using the HTTP method given in the request-method parameter. The response body that is returned by this request is placed in the response-entity transport parameter, which is then taken apart by the mapping section of the outbound bindings.</p> <p>This service expects the response-entity to be similar to the following:</p> <pre><code>1: &lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt; \n2: &lt;GeocodeResponse&gt; \n3:  &lt;status&gt;OK&lt;/status&gt; \n4:  &lt;result&gt; \n5:   &lt;type&gt;street_address&lt;/type&gt; \n6:   &lt;formatted_address&gt;1 New Orchard Rd, Armonk, NY, USA&lt;/formatted_address&gt; \n7:   &lt;address_component&gt; \n8:    &lt;long_name&gt;1&lt;/long_name&gt; \n9:    &lt;short_name&gt;1&lt;/short_name&gt; \n10:    &lt;type&gt;street_number&lt;/type&gt; \n11:   &lt;/address_component&gt; \n12:   &lt;address_component&gt; \n13:    &lt;long_name&gt;New Orchard Rd&lt;/long_name&gt; \n14:    &lt;short_name&gt;New Orchard Rd&lt;/short_name&gt; \n15:    &lt;type&gt;route&lt;/type&gt; \n16:   &lt;/address_component&gt; \n17:   &lt;address_component&gt; \n18:    &lt;long_name&gt;Armonk&lt;/long_name&gt; \n19:    &lt;short_name&gt;Armonk&lt;/short_name&gt; \n20:    &lt;type&gt;locality&lt;/type&gt; \n21:    &lt;type&gt;political&lt;/type&gt; \n22:   &lt;/address_component&gt; \n23:   &lt;address_component&gt; \n24:    &lt;long_name&gt;Westchester&lt;/long_name&gt; \n25:    &lt;short_name&gt;Westchester&lt;/short_name&gt; \n26:    &lt;type&gt;administrative_area_level_2&lt;/type&gt; \n27:    &lt;type&gt;political&lt;/type&gt; \n28:   &lt;/address_component&gt; \n29:   &lt;address_component&gt; \n30:    &lt;long_name&gt;New York&lt;/long_name&gt; \n31:    &lt;short_name&gt;NY&lt;/short_name&gt; \n32:    &lt;type&gt;administrative_area_level_1&lt;/type&gt; \n33:    &lt;type&gt;political&lt;/type&gt; \n34:   &lt;/address_component&gt; \n35:   &lt;address_component&gt; \n36:    &lt;long_name&gt;United States&lt;/long_name&gt; \n37:    &lt;short_name&gt;US&lt;/short_name&gt; \n38:    &lt;type&gt;country&lt;/type&gt; \n39:    &lt;type&gt;political&lt;/type&gt; \n40:   &lt;/address_component&gt; \n41:   &lt;geometry&gt; \n42:    &lt;location&gt; \n43:     &lt;lat&gt;41.1083018&lt;/lat&gt; \n44:     &lt;lng&gt;-73.7204677&lt;/lng&gt; \n45:    &lt;/location&gt; \n46:    &lt;location_type&gt;ROOFTOP&lt;/location_type&gt; \n47:    &lt;viewport&gt; \n48:     &lt;southwest&gt; \n49:      &lt;lat&gt;41.1051542&lt;/lat&gt; \n50:      &lt;lng&gt;-73.7236153&lt;/lng&gt; \n51:     &lt;/southwest&gt; \n52:     &lt;northeast&gt; \n53:      &lt;lat&gt;41.1114494&lt;/lat&gt; \n54:      &lt;lng&gt;-73.7173201&lt;/lng&gt; \n55:     &lt;/northeast&gt; \n56:    &lt;/viewport&gt; \n57:   &lt;/geometry&gt; \n58:  &lt;/result&gt; \n59: &lt;/GeocodeResponse&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>There is much data in this response, but only some of it is needed for this Service Description. The latitude, longitude, and a list of the address information from the first result is required. To get only the required information, the Service Description outlines the parameters that it expects to return in the parameters section, in lines 42-87. The Service Description then uses the mapping section, in lines 88-108, to extract the required data from the response-entity transport parameter. Each of the parameters in the parameters section is self-explanatory. Latitude and longitude are top-level parameters because there is only one of each of them in a single result. However, there are several address_component elements, each of which are returned. Therefore, the address-information parameter is a list parameter that contains subparameters, one for each of the pieces of information in an address_component that the Service Description wants to make available.</p> <p>In lines 88-108, the service mapping section defines all the mapping that must be performed to extract the data from the XML response. Latitude, which is specified in lines 90-93, and longitude, which is specified in lines 94-97, each extract the data using a single XPath expression. The source type for each is set to XML. Mapping of a repeating structure is accomplished in a similar fashion. Lines 98-101 define the mapping for the address-information parameter. The XPath expression for address-information returns a nodeset as there are several nodes that match the expression GeocodeResponse/result/address_component. For each node that is returned, a new structure is created to contain the result of each of the submappings. Each of the submappings places its target into the newly created structure. Since the source of each of the submappings is one of the matched nodes, the mapping elements do not specify a source. It is assumed to be the inherited context. Similarly, the reference is evaluated within the context of the source, which is inherited. After each of the submappings is evaluated for a single source, the structure is added to a running list and the submappings are evaluated again for the next result in the source list.

The table contains limitations, best practices, and known issues.</p> <p>Table 1. Known limitations of Leap</p> Limitations Resolution HCL Connections Community Surveys are not available in Leap 8.6.0 and later versions. To add Surveys to your Connections application, you must use Leap 8.5 with Connections 4.5, or Leap 8.5.1 with Connections 5.0. Form item size limitations. When building a Leap application, you must not exceed the following size limits You cannot have more than 1000 data items in your form You cannot have more than 200 data items in your form DB2\u00ae has a page size limit for tables of 32kb. Each data item in a Leap application has a size limit. For example: - Single Line \u2013 200 bytes and Multiple line - Leap uses a CLOB data type to store the value of each multiple line entry data item. The limit to the number of characters stored in a CLOB is dependent on language and character set. The English limit is approximately 1 million characters.If the content of any given multiple line field exceeds the database allowance, you see a \u201c500 Internal Server Error\u201d message, and form submission fails. The full message is stored in the system log files. -   Currency/Number \u2013 8 bytes -   Attachment \u2013 108 bytes -   Select One and Survey \u2013 size is based on the number of choices and questions If you receive the error The row length of the table exceeded a limit of \u201c32677\u201d bytes. (Table space \u201c\u201d.). SQLCODE=-670, your form exceeds the maximum size. You must remove items from the form, or break the application into multiple forms. It is important to note that items create database columns, and contribute to the limit even when they are hidden on the form. Note: This is no longer applicable as of DB2 10.5 and newer, due to extended row size. Limit on the number of embedded sections. When designing a form in Leap, you can embed sections within sections to achieve the wanted layout. Do not embed more than 5 sections within one another. When using more than five embedded sections, it becomes difficult to select the action icons for a specific section. Exceeding 5 sections also results in forms not rendering properly. Printing Leap content Leap provides a print button. If there is no print button in the contents of your form, the web browser print function does not work well. To print out the contents shown in your browser, uses a screen capture. For more information, see Taking a screen capture in Windows\u2122. Adding Groups to Leap applications. Leap cannot resolve users if they are members of nested groups. For example, your company LDAP contains a super group called \u201cManagers\u201d. This super group consists of several smaller groups, such as \u201cSupervisors\u201d, and \u201cShift Leaders\u201d. In the Access tab of Leap, you must add the \u201cSupervisors\u201d, and \u201cShift Leaders\u201d as groups individually, rather than using the \u201cManagers\u201d super group. <p>Table 2. Leap Best Practices</p> Issue Resolution Canonical URLs versus short URL in the ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.serverURI property of the Leap_config.properties file When accessing Leap, the ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.serverURI entry setting is different from the browser address base URI. If you are using a short URL format to design your application, you must set ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.serverURI entry with the canonical URL. For example, if your short URL is http://localhost:9080/apps, the canonical URL for the user is http://hostname:9080/apps. Using two different URLs means users must sign on twice, as the short URL is replaced by the canonical URL. It is a best practice to use the canonical URL whenever possible. Web Link and Website form items. When using the Web Link or Website form items in your application, ensure that you enter the correct URL to get the runtime result. If the link goes to an external site, you must enter the URL with a URL protocol. For example, enter the URL as http://www.ibm.com, rather than www.ibm.com. -   If you enter the URL with no protocol, then the URL is considered relative the current location. The prefix for the relative URL is attached, which might result in errors. -   If you enter the URL with a single slash '/', it resolves to a URL relative to the root of the host. When using the Website item in a Leap the URLs entered must begin with: http://, https://, ftp://, or ftps:// Leap users and groups When using WebSphere\u00ae Application Server to directly maintain users and groups, it is important to maintain integrity between the WebSphere Application Server users and Leap. If you change a user definition in WebSphere Application Server, and that user is used in Leap, the relationship might be corrupted. The user would no longer be able to access Leap. Uploading files in Leap If an application requires supplemental files, it is a best practice to use reference URLs, rather than uploading the files directly into the application. The option to include reference URLs is available in the Upload dialog from the Settings tab. Leap Preview mode To use the Leap Preview feature, you must ensure that your browser is configured to allow all pop-up windows. If your browser does not allow pop-up windows, users cannot see the preview window. Browser cookies must be enabled. To successfully log in Leap, you must have browser cookie enabled. If you have deployed Leap with WebSphere Application Server Community Edition as your application server, you must ensure that you have only one Leap window or tab running in your browser at any time. Attempting to log in to multiple Leap windows or tabs results in login errors. <p>Table 3. Troubleshooting Leap errors</p> Problem Resolution Building Leap applications in Safari with bidirectional languages Designing Leap applications with the Safari locale set to a bidirectional language results in extraneous horizontal scroll bars shown in each form cell. These scroll bars do not affect the rendering of the completed form at run time. Allowing non-ASCII administrative login characters If the Leap administrative user name or password contains non-ASCII characters, you must complete an additional configuration task. In WebSphere Application Server: 1.  Log in to WebSphere Application Server administrative console, and select the server. 2.  On the settings page for the selected application server, go to Server Infrastructure &gt; Java and Process Management. 3.  Go to Process Definition &gt; Java Virtual Machine, and specify -Dclient.encoding.override=UTF-8 for Generic JVM Arguments. 4.  Click OK, then Save 5.  Restart the application server <p>Table 4. General Leap information</p> Topic Additional Information Using the Upgrade link on the Manage tab. You can upgrade an application with a new application definition using theLeap Upgrade feature. Upgrading replaces all access rules, business rules, formulas, interface options, Stages definitions, JavaScript\u2122, images, and service mappings with those in the new version.

The form item is placed into the grid location. You can build forms by placing form items directly on the form or grouping form items in Sections. For our coffee feedback form, we use Sections to organize the form items. Sections are useful for the following reasons:</p> </li> <li> <p>They group form items in a way that is easy for the user to understand. When the form is viewed, the sections have specific background colors that are based on the style that is applied to the form.</p> </li> <li>They make applying complex form functionality easier. For example, our form has a rule to hide the survey until the user selects a specific option. Instead of setting the rule on every form item individually, the rule is on the section. The rule applies to every form item within the section.</li> <li>They allow the form designer, and the form user, to collapse and expand entire parts of the form. In longer forms, collapsing sections is useful, as it keeps the form submitter from being overwhelmed by too much information.</li> <li>If you finish building your form and decide to change the layout, moving sections of form items is much easier than moving each form item individually.

If these types of form items are too close together, the Media item blocks the pop-ups of the other form items.</p> <ol> <li> <p>In the Palette, click Specialized.</p> <p>The list of specialized form items expands.</p> </li> <li> <p>Select Media and drop it onto the form.</p> </li> <li> <p>The properties side panel appears so you can configure the media file.</p> </li> <li> <p>Click Add file to upload a file, or point to a URL that hosts the file.</p> <p>Or you can select previously uploaded media from the Media drop-down menu.</p> <ol> <li> <p>To set a media item to display on an iPad, click Use a file on the internet.</p> </li> <li> <p>Set the URL for the file, then select Maintain a link to the file only.

For example, in a job application you can build a table that asks for work history. You can create columns such as the \u201cCompany Name\u201d, \u201cJob Title\u201d, \u201cStart Date\u201d, and \u201cEnd Date\u201d. The user can add as many rows under these columns as required to provide their work history. In many cases, it is not feasible to add individual items for each repeating element as you cannot know in advance how many repeating elements the use requires. To achieve this functionality, the Table form item contains the following two complimentary elements:</p> <ul> <li>Child form \u2013 The Child form is a supporting form that contains the form items that collect the repeated data. In the \u201cwork history\u201d example, the child form contains a Date form item for collecting the \u201cStart Date\u201d of a previous job. A child form is similar to a regular form, however it is limited to a single page. When a user completes their job history, the child form is shown in a dialog box. The user can enter as many rows as required to submit a complete job history. In the Outline view, the child form is called \"Table\", and is listed as a subset of the parent page.</li> <li> <p>Table display \u2013 The Table display shows the data entries that are collected by the child form. The columns in the table represent the individual items from the child form. The visibility of specific columns in the table is configurable in the properties side panel.</p> </li> <li> <p>In the Palette, click Specialized.</p> <p>The list of specialized form items expands.</p> </li> <li> <p>Select Table, and drop it onto the form.</p> <p>Adding the table creates a Table child form in the Outline view.</p> </li> <li> <p>In the table, click the link to access the child form, and define the table columns by selecting form items from the Common Palette.</p> <p>Ensure that you give each form item a specific name as the items added to the Table child form become column titles for the table.</p> <p>For example, if you insert a Single Line Entry form item to record someone\u2019s name, you must change the title of the item, or the table on the will display \u201cSingle Line Entry\u201d. The title of the form item is not helpful to users. You will then have to manually adjust the item name using the Properties side panel.</p> </li> <li> <p>When you have built your table, go to the Outline view on the right side of the screen and click the parent Page.</p> <p>You are returned to the main form design area.
