To make designing forms and applications easier for users with disabilities, Leap has the following keyboard shortcuts: Adding items to your form To add items to your form from the Palette, set focus on the form item with the Tab key and press Enter. The item appears on the form where indicated by a blue line. Focus indicator When a form item has focus the background changes color, and the area that is occupied by the form item is defined by a colored line. Item triggers When an item has focus, you can trigger it by pressing the Enter key or space bar. The browser that you use determines whether you must press the Enter key or space bar. Tab key You can navigate to any visible form item, link, or menu by pressing the Tab key. Tab navigation The Properties side panel contains multiple tabs. To navigate between tabs, use the arrow keys. Tab order of form items When you place items on a form, the tab order is set based on item placement. If you insert a form item before existing items, the tab order is automatically reset. You do not have to manually configure tab order when you insert additional items into a form. Navigating between Palettes You can navigate between the Common, and Specialized palettes. When the focus is on one Palette use any arrow key to collapse the open Palette and expand another one. If you want to switch palettes while focus is on a form item, you must use the Tab key to move to the palette name, then navigate with the arrow keys. You cannot navigate between palettes when a form item has focus. Keyboard commands for common items Leap has three menu items: Save , Preview , and Cancel . The following keyboard commands are available so you do not have to navigate away from your form. Save: Ctrl+s Preview: Ctrl+e Cancel: Ctrl+q When designing forms the Properties side panel contains a box titled \u201cAccessibility - Alternative text ID\u201d. Use this box to provide a text description that is used by accessibility tools to describe the item. The following WAI ARIA attributes are automatically added to form items when you design forms: aria-labelledby and Aria-label are added to fields to associate the correct label with each field. aria-describedby are added to fields where more description is needed to describe the function of a field. aria-required is added to inform a user that the field is mandatory. aria-invalid is added to fields when the value is not valid. aria-alert is used with Aria-invalid in error messages. Screen readers read the Aria-alert text to the user. aria-valuemin and aria-valuemax are used to denote if the file has an acceptable value range. If the value is outside the range, the aria-invalid attribute is set.

HCL Leap is designed to make building accessible forms easy. For example, the tab order of form items is set to start at the first item on the page, and work through consecutive items. You do not have to reset the tab order if you must add items to the beginning of a form. There are several things that you can do to make your forms more accessible to users with disabilities: During the creation of your application, accessibility standards, such as WCAG 2.0 , should be considered with regards to layout and content. Leap does not prevent authors from creating non-accessible forms. When you add items to your form, give each form item a clear description or name. Screen readers read the name that is associated with a form item. You can also use a Text item as a data label instead of the field provided. For more information, see Using a Text item as a label . Add hints to each form item by modifying the Add hint field. The Hint provides more information when read to the user. For example, if your form has a Name field, the hint tells the user your preference for how to enter their given and surnames. Text blocks are not automatically part of the tab order. Screen readers do not put focus on text blocks, and your users might miss vital information. To ensure that text information is not omitted, select the text item, in the properties side panel, select the check box for Add to tab order . The text is added to the tab order, and is read by screen readers. If you add images or media items to your forms, open the Properties side panel and add descriptive text to the Alternative text property. A screen reader uses the alternative text to describe the image or media item to the user. You can add text items to your form and have them associate with other form items. You can use this technique to create formatted titles for your form items. However, you must link the text item and the form item together. For example, you have a Select One item on your form. You want its title to be rich text so it can have a color, background, and format different from the default title. You add the title with the Text form item, which gives the formatting you want. However, the text item is not read by the screen reader, and the user might not know what the choice list represents. To ensure that the Text field is read by a screen reader, go to the choice list Properties side panel. Insert the name of the Text field into the Accessibility \u2013 Alternative label ID field. A screen reader reads the appropriate text for the choice list. When using the new dynamic layout, it might be necessary to group items into Sections to convey the proper meaning to users. For example, when creating a custom label via the alternative text ID option. When using Sections , if a label exists, it provides a navigation landmark using WAI-ARIA that is available to assistive technologies. For more information, WAI_ARIA roles .

HCL Leap uses a customizable role-based model to define who can access data and who can modify the application. Roles allow the assignment of data access, and application maintenance permissions.Individuals or groups are then assigned to the roles with the access component, or programmatically through web services. There are three predefined roles: Administrator A role that includes users, or groups, with administrator privileges for an application. Initiator A role that includes any user, or group, who can submit a form or initiate an application. For example, if the application was for Vacation Requests, you can allow all users in your organization to initiate, or submit, a Vacation Request. Record Owner A role that contains the user, or group, who submitted the form dynamically at run time. Each role can be Open (dynamic) or Closed (static). Open roles \u2013 where assignments are done either statically, or dynamically with a web service call defined on a stage action within stages. Users are assigned based on data that is gathered during the form submission. For example, a web service looks up a manager for each user who submits a form, and assigns the manager a role. Closed roles \u2013 where assignments of users and groups to the roles must be done explicitly from within the Access tab. Closed roles do not assign users dynamically with a web service.

This setting determines anonymous access, where: enabled - anonymous access is blocked disabled - anonymous access is allowed redirect - redirects the user to authenticate Default value: redirect Example: ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.blockAnonAccess=redirect customThemes.[ID].displayName customThemes.[ID].location customThemes.[ID].isDefault customThemes.[ID].nl.[LOCALE] The customThemes config settings define a list of customer-provided themes that can be used in Leap applications. For each theme, two parameters must be set: customThemes.[ID].displayName customThemes.[ID].location [ID] - An identifier for the custom theme (e.g. \"corpTheme1\"). The id can contain the letters 'a' through 'z' and numbers, and must start with a letter. displayName - The theme name to be displayed in the Leap authoring UI. location -The full URL of the theme's .css file. For each theme, there are 2 optional parameters: customThemes.[ID].isDefault customThemes.[ID].nl.[LOCALE] isDefault - If set to true, designates the theme as the default selection for new applications. nl.[LOCALE] - For globalization support of the theme's display name. [LOCALE] is the locale code that identifies the language (e.g.,\"en\", \"fr\", \"fr_CA\", \"zh\"). After modifying these settings, restart the Leap server to see the changes in the authoring environment. If the location property of a theme is modified, any deployed applications using that custom theme need to be redeployed for changes to take affect. Examples: customThemes.corpTheme1.displayName = Corporate Theme 1 customThemes.corpTheme1.nl.fr = Th\u00e8me d'entreprise 1 customThemes.corpTheme1.nl.zh = \u4f01\u4e1a\u4e3b\u98981 customThemes.corpTheme1.isDefault = true customThemes.corpTheme1.location =https://mycompany.com/theme1.css detectBrowser If Leap detects an unsupported browser, a warning message is displayed to the user. The user can still see the form after the warning message is closed.Where: warn - The user is warned that the browser is unsupported. A list of supported browsers is displayed in the warning message. When the user closes the warning message, the form is displayed. ignore - The user is not warned that the browser is unsupported, and the form is displayed. Default value: warn Example: ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.detectBrowser=ignore disableUseTab Hides the \"Use\" tab, and prevents fetching the list of deployed and usable applications, where: true - \"Use\" tab is hidden false - \"Use\" tab is displayed Default value: false Example: ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.disableUseTab=true EventHandler.infoLevelEvents EventHandler.debugLevelEvents EventHandler.auditLevelEvents Leap contains an event handling implementation that enables printing out all or specific events in the system log or in a separate file based on properties setting, by default this feature is not enabled. Change properties, in the Leap_config.properties file, to monitor events that you are interested in, and where you want to output the event information. The following will output Events information in Application Server's system log at info or debug level: EventHandler.infoLevelEvents EventHandler.debugLevelEvents auditLevelEvents will output to a file. The default file location on Windows is C:\\febEvents.log and AIX/Linux is /febEvents.log, with maximum file size 5MB, back up to 5 files. The content of the event output is in CSV format, the description of the data: Event topic, Event time stamp, User id, User email, Application uid, Application title, Form id, Record uid, Result The following is the list of event topics that Leap sends out: builder/app/delete \u2013 Application is deleted builder builder/app/deploy \u2013 Application is deployed for the first time builder/app/redeploy \u2013 A deployed application is deployed again builder/app/stop \u2013 A deployed application is stopped builder/app/import \u2013 Application is imported builder/app/importAndDeploy \u2013 Application is imported and deployed builder/app/importAndDeployWithData \u2013 Application is imported and deployed with data builder/app/export \u2013 Application is exported builder/app/exportWithData \u2013 Application is exported with data builder/app/upgrade \u2013 Application is upgraded builder/app/upgradeWithDataReplaced \u2013 Application is upgraded and the data replaced builder/app/result/export \u2013 Application data is exported from View Data (or REST API) builder/app/retrieve/source \u2013 Application source is retrieved builder/app/query/deployed \u2013 Application deployment state is queried builder/record/submit \u2013 A record is submitted by normal app usage builder/record/update \u2013 A record is updated by normal app usage builder/record/delete \u2013 A record is deleted by normal app usage builder/data/insert/user \u2013 A record is created as a result of a direct user action builder/data/insert/code \u2013 A record is created indirectly builder/data/update/user \u2013 A record is updated as a result of a direct user action builder/data/update/code \u2013 A record is updated indirectly builder/data/delete/user \u2013 A record is deleted as a result of a direct user action builder/data/delete/code \u2013 A record is deleted indirectly To capture failed events, use \"builder/error/[EVENT_TOPIC]\" Example: ibm.nitro.EventHandler.infoLevelEvents=builder/record/submit,builder/error/builder/record/submit exportDataWithEmails By default when you export data from applications, emails are also exported. You can exclude emails from the export by changing the property value to false. Where: true - emails are exported with application data false - emails are not exported with application data Default value: true Example: ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.exportDataWithEmails=true imageDomainWhitelist.enabled=true imageDomainWhitelist.[N].domain The imageDomainWhitelist config settings define a white-list of domains from where images can be uploaded to a Rich Text Entry field. In addition to setting the following: imageDomainWhitelist.enabled=true for each domain an additional parameters must be set. imageDomainWhitelist.[N].domain = where \"[N]\" is an integer number identifying that service. domain - The domain property implicitly allows sub-domains. For example, a domain property of example.com allows URLs such as https://www.example.com/anything, http://api.example.com/anything, or https://example.com/anything. Examples: ibm.nitro.imageDomainWhitelist.enabled=true ibm.nitro.imageDomainWhitelist.[1].domain=http://acme.com ibm.nitro.imageDomainWhitelist.[2].domain=http://acme2.com InfoEntryPoint.dailyInfo Provides HTML content that is shown in the login screen. Can be used for status messages, or help. ibm.nitro.InfoEntryPoint.dailyInfo = Welcome to <b>HCL Leap</b> LogoutServlet.postLogoutRedirectURL The value of this parameter tells Leap where to redirect user after log off. If the parameter is not configured or left blank, the user is redirected to the login page. Example: ibm.nitro.LogoutServlet.postLogoutRedirectURL=http://example_url.com/signout maximumRecordsToRetrieve Maximum number of records that are permitted for export from the View Data page at one time. If the number of records to be exported exceeds the number set by this property, the export is stopped, and an error message is shown. Note: The default value of 20,000 is supported for base systems. Setting the value higher could result in poor performance, depending on result set size and server hardware. Example: ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.maximumRecordsToRetrieve=25000 MemberManager.adminAlias MemberManager.userProps.loginName MemberManager.userProps.id MemberManager.groupProps.id MemberManager.userProps.email MemberManager.userProps.displayName MemberManager.adminAlias setting is mandatory. For WebSphere Application Server only, configure the VMM login. By default, Leap uses J2C alias vmmAdmin to authenticate with VMM. You must configure it here if you want to change the J2C alias name. You must have WebSphere Application Server administrative user credentials to run Leap If you use LDAP within WebSphere Application Server, there are a number of properties that look up user and group information. If your LDAP uses different property keys than the ones set by default, update the property keys here so that user and group look up function correctly. If you are using LDAP within WebSphere Application Server, refer to the following settings: MemberManager.userProps.loginName Describes the LDAP property used as the login ID. Each loginName must be unique. Default setting: uid MemberManager.userProps.id Represents a unique key for the user. This key must be identical to the loginName. Default setting: uid MemberManager.groupProps.id Represents a unique key for the group. The value is the LDAP property that is used. For example, cn, represents Common Name. Default setting: cn MemberManager.userProps.email The email address of the user. Leap uses this email address to send notifications and other emails to the user. Default setting: mail MemberManager.userProps.displayName Used to display the name of the user, instead of the login id. Default setting: cn Examples: ibm.was.MemberManager.userProps.loginName = mail ibm.was.MemberManager.userProps.id = mail ibm.was.MemberManager.groupProps.id = name ibm.was.MemberManager.userProps.email = mail ibm.was.MemberManager.userProps.displayName = cn purgeOrphanFilesHours In some circumstances, files attached to either application designs or user-submitted records can become orphaned if the primary design or record element is removed outside the normal process. File records which are older than this number of hours and are no longer associated with an existing primary record are removed. Default value: 48 Example: ibm.nitro.purgeOrphanFilesHours=36 runtimeCSP The runtimeCSP setting defines the Content-Security-Policy (CSP) header that will be applied to running Forms. Note: This setting only applies to Forms. It does not currently apply to App Pages, Summary Charts, or the View Data page. For more information on CSP, see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP For more information on Strict CSP, see Strict CSP Example: ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.runtimeCSP=default-src 'self' *.example.com; img-src * runtimeResources.[N] Additional web resources to load into the Leap UI for leveraging the Custom Widget API . The values from these settings will be injected into the <head> section of Leap's HTML pages. Example: ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.runtimeResources.1 = <link rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' media='screen' href='/custom-widgets/samples/acme/Acme_Widgets.css'> ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.runtimeResources.2 = <script type='text/javascript' src='/custom-widgets/samples/acme/Acme_common.js'></script> ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.runtimeResources.3 = <script type='text/javascript' src='/custom-widgets/samples/acme/Acme_Boolean_Widget.js'></script> secureJS Enables or disables JavaScript restrictions in run time forms. When a form designer adds custom JavaScript to an application, this flag restricts the scope of that custom JavaScript. This flag applies to the entire Leap server for all users. Note: Setting this parameter to false might expose users to malicious JavaScript. Only set to false in a secured environment where Leap applications are created by trusted users. For more information, see JavaScript API for Leap. Default value: true Example: ibm.nitro.ApplicationCompilerService.secureJS = false serviceAuthorization.enabled serviceAuthorization.[SERVICE_ID] Access to a service description may be given to a specific user, group, or special assignment. The access control is made up of two parts: Who may \"discover\" and work with the service while designing an application. Who may \"invoke\" the service. Users or Groups provided must be defined using the attributes defined by ibm.was.MemberManager.userProps.id = mail and ibm.was.MemberManager.groupProps.id = name respectively. Special assignment valid values are: all-authenticated: for app author \"discover\" privilege only anonymous: for app authors and end-user \"discover\" and \"invoke\" privileges all-authors: for end-user \"invoke\" privilege only To enable service authorizations, set ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.serviceAuthorization.enabled=true . Multiple services may be defined. To define a service authorization, add ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.serviceAuthorization.serviceIdN where serviceIdN is the 'id' of the service description. The value must be a valid JSON string, see provided samples. Note: A backslash (\\) at the end of a line can be used to present a value over multiple lines. The backslash must be the very last character on the line. Examples: ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.serviceAuthorization.enabled = true ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.serviceAuthorization.serviceId1 = { \\ \"comment\": \"Auth for Service 1\", \\ \"discover\": { \"users\": [\"user1\"], \"groups\": [\"group1\"], \"special\": [] }, \\ \"invoke\": { \"users\": [], \"groups\": [], \"special\": [\"all-authenticated\"]\" } \\ } serverURI Indicates the base URI used for critical functions, including editing applications, and email. Must include everything necessary to connect to the Leap context, for example, /apps. With this entry, all emailed links, and absolute links visible during Leap design time start with the following base URI regardless of what the user enters in the address bar. Example: ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.serverURI = https://leap.example.com/apps servicesWhitelist.enabled servicesWhitelist.[N].actions servicesWhitelist.[N].domain The servicesWhitelist config settings define a white list of domains and HTTP actions that app authors are allowed to call directly from their applications using URL based services. In addition to setting servicesWhitelist.enabled=true , for each service two additional parameters must be set: servicesWhitelist.[N].domain = servicesWhitelist.[N].actions = The domain property implicitly allows sub-domains. For example, a domain property of example.com allows URLs such as https://www.example.com/anything, http://api.example.com/anything, or https://example.com/anything. The https or http protocol included in the domain property is respected. For example, a domain property of https://api.example.com only allows calls to secure SSL https://api.example.com/anything and not to non-secure http://api.example.com/anything. The actions property is a comma-separated list of the HTTP actions allowed for a particular domain. Valid values are GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, HEAD, and PATCH. If the actions value is missing, no actions are allowed. Where [N] is an integer number identifying that service. Default value: true Examples: ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.servicesWhitelist.enabled = true ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.servicesWhitelist.1.domain = example.com ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.servicesWhitelist.1.actions = GET ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.servicesWhitelist.2.domain = https://securehost.com ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.servicesWhitelist.2.actions = GET, POST,PUT Note: This white-list has no effect on service descriptions and custom service transports that were installed on the server by the administrator. SetupAll.setupStatus After deploying Leap for the first time or upgrading to a newer version, there is a setup screen that is presented upon accessing the manage page. This setup screen shows the status of detecting and updating the database tables, checks that security is properly enabled, and a mail session is configured. This page requires the admin to click a button to fully progress through the setup. To disable this setup page and required admin interaction add the property: ibm.nitro.SetupAll.setupStatus = start viewResponsesMaximumCount For DB2\u00ae or Oracle. The maximum number of records that are counted when returning record sets in pages. If the total number of records exceeds viewResponsesMaximumCount, then paging indicators will no longer accurately lists the total number of pages. Setting this value higher can have performance consequences for the server if there are many users viewing forms with large response lists. Default value: 1000 Example: ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.viewResponsesMaximumCount=2000 xFrameOptions Use this setting to control the X-Frame-Options response header for Leap pages, which determines if Leap can be embedded into other web pages. Example: ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.xFrameOptions = SAMEORIGIN Parent topic: Configuring the properties file","title":"Configuration properties"},{"location":"co_configuration_properties.html#configuration-properties","text":"The following table contains a list of properties in the HCL Leap Leap_config.properties file.

For more information on CSP, see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP For more information on Strict CSP, see Strict CSP Example: ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.runtimeCSP=default-src 'self' *.example.com; img-src * runtimeResources.[N] Additional web resources to load into the Leap UI for leveraging the Custom Widget API . The values from these settings will be injected into the <head> section of Leap's HTML pages. Example: ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.runtimeResources.1 = <link rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' media='screen' href='/custom-widgets/samples/acme/Acme_Widgets.css'> ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.runtimeResources.2 = <script type='text/javascript' src='/custom-widgets/samples/acme/Acme_common.js'></script> ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.runtimeResources.3 = <script type='text/javascript' src='/custom-widgets/samples/acme/Acme_Boolean_Widget.js'></script> secureJS Enables or disables JavaScript restrictions in run time forms. When a form designer adds custom JavaScript to an application, this flag restricts the scope of that custom JavaScript. This flag applies to the entire Leap server for all users. Note: Setting this parameter to false might expose users to malicious JavaScript. Only set to false in a secured environment where Leap applications are created by trusted users. For more information, see JavaScript API for Leap. Default value: true Example: ibm.nitro.ApplicationCompilerService.secureJS = false serviceAuthorization.enabled serviceAuthorization.[SERVICE_ID] Access to a service description may be given to a specific user, group, or special assignment. The access control is made up of two parts: Who may \"discover\" and work with the service while designing an application. Who may \"invoke\" the service. Users or Groups provided must be defined using the attributes defined by ibm.was.MemberManager.userProps.id = mail and ibm.was.MemberManager.groupProps.id = name respectively. Special assignment valid values are: all-authenticated: for app author \"discover\" privilege only anonymous: for app authors and end-user \"discover\" and \"invoke\" privileges all-authors: for end-user \"invoke\" privilege only To enable service authorizations, set ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.serviceAuthorization.enabled=true . Multiple services may be defined. To define a service authorization, add ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.serviceAuthorization.serviceIdN where serviceIdN is the 'id' of the service description. The value must be a valid JSON string, see provided samples. Note: A backslash (\\) at the end of a line can be used to present a value over multiple lines. The backslash must be the very last character on the line. Examples: ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.serviceAuthorization.enabled = true ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.serviceAuthorization.serviceId1 = { \\ \"comment\": \"Auth for Service 1\", \\ \"discover\": { \"users\": [\"user1\"], \"groups\": [\"group1\"], \"special\": [] }, \\ \"invoke\": { \"users\": [], \"groups\": [], \"special\": [\"all-authenticated\"]\" } \\ } serverURI Indicates the base URI used for critical functions, including editing applications, and email. Must include everything necessary to connect to the Leap context, for example, /apps. With this entry, all emailed links, and absolute links visible during Leap design time start with the following base URI regardless of what the user enters in the address bar. Example: ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.serverURI = https://leap.example.com/apps servicesWhitelist.enabled servicesWhitelist.[N].actions servicesWhitelist.[N].domain The servicesWhitelist config settings define a white list of domains and HTTP actions that app authors are allowed to call directly from their applications using URL based services. In addition to setting servicesWhitelist.enabled=true , for each service two additional parameters must be set: servicesWhitelist.[N].domain = servicesWhitelist.[N].actions = The domain property implicitly allows sub-domains. For example, a domain property of example.com allows URLs such as https://www.example.com/anything, http://api.example.com/anything, or https://example.com/anything. The https or http protocol included in the domain property is respected. For example, a domain property of https://api.example.com only allows calls to secure SSL https://api.example.com/anything and not to non-secure http://api.example.com/anything. The actions property is a comma-separated list of the HTTP actions allowed for a particular domain. Valid values are GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, HEAD, and PATCH. If the actions value is missing, no actions are allowed. Where [N] is an integer number identifying that service. Default value: true Examples: ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.servicesWhitelist.enabled = true ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.servicesWhitelist.1.domain = example.com ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.servicesWhitelist.1.actions = GET ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.servicesWhitelist.2.domain = https://securehost.com ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.servicesWhitelist.2.actions = GET, POST,PUT Note: This white-list has no effect on service descriptions and custom service transports that were installed on the server by the administrator. SetupAll.setupStatus After deploying Leap for the first time or upgrading to a newer version, there is a setup screen that is presented upon accessing the manage page. This setup screen shows the status of detecting and updating the database tables, checks that security is properly enabled, and a mail session is configured. This page requires the admin to click a button to fully progress through the setup. To disable this setup page and required admin interaction add the property: ibm.nitro.SetupAll.setupStatus = start viewResponsesMaximumCount For DB2\u00ae or Oracle. The maximum number of records that are counted when returning record sets in pages. If the total number of records exceeds viewResponsesMaximumCount, then paging indicators will no longer accurately lists the total number of pages. Setting this value higher can have performance consequences for the server if there are many users viewing forms with large response lists. Default value: 1000 Example: ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.viewResponsesMaximumCount=2000 xFrameOptions Use this setting to control the X-Frame-Options response header for Leap pages, which determines if Leap can be embedded into other web pages.

The following steps describe how to prepare a spreadsheet that you want to import into Leap and how to create the application from the spreadsheet. Prepare the spreadsheet for importation. Points to consider: Each sheet in the spreadsheet file will be turned into a form in a new application. The first non-empty row in the sheet will be considered the 'header row'. If all the sheets in the spreadsheet have no header rows, the import will fail. The contents of a header row cell will be the name of the widget for that column. There can be a horizontal gap of a single cell between the header row cells. If there is a gap of more than one cell in the header row, then the cells to the right of the gap will not be processed. Header titles get processed to only have valid characters and then are assigned to the corresponding widget name. If after processing there are too few characters, the widget gets a default name. The contents of cells under the header row cell will be used for the data import process. There can be one gap of up to two columns in the data and header row. There can be a gap between the left-hand edge of the spreadsheet and the header row. There can be a gap between the header row and data. Parsing of rows will stop after parsing 10 empty rows in a row. If the column under a non-blank header row cell is empty, then the resulting widget will be a single line entry. Web links must have https:// or http:// at the beginning of the URL. Select many widgets can be created when the contents of a cell contains [value],[value],[value].... with no spaces between values and commas. Values cannot be duplicated, and the cell cannot begin or end with a comma. Commas are used as delimiters for multi select widgets; therefore, any comma will not be part of the value itself and will separate values. For a widget to be selectable (i.e. a Dropdown, Select One, Select Many, etc.), then the number of possible values must be greater than one and less than a certain value, currently set at 30. If there are only numbers and currency cells in a column, then the column widget type will be whichever count is greater. Log on to Leap.

An application can have one theme; the theme is applied to all forms in the application. Themes are customized in the Style tab. Settings made in the General section of the Theme Editor will be applied to specific attributes of all items in your application, but will be overridden by settings made to a more specific item type. For example, settings made in General > Fonts > General can be overridden by values set in General > Fonts > Label Fonts or set in Buttons > Fonts . A section's background color and border visibility can be set in the item's properties. This will override the theme settings. Background images maintain aspect ratio, but are stretched to fit the browser window. During application design, themes, and custom CSS are not applied to your application. To see how your application will display to end users, use the Preview button in either the Theme Editor dialog or the main banner. Browsers support different font file types (eg. .woff, .woff2, .ttf, eot, and .otf), so when specifying a custom font in your theme, you may need to include multiple font file types for a specific font family in order for it to render in all browsers. Themes can be exported and then imported into another application. To increase the portability of your customized theme, use the option to Maintain a link to the file only for font files and background image, instead of importing them into your application. Some limitations exist in IE8, including differences around the way IE8 displays background images. Custom CSS can be used in combination with themes. Custom CSS that you have included in your application is applied after all theme styling is applied except when the replace theme checkbox is selected. In this case, the custom CSS is the only styling that is applied to your application. CSS precedence rules still apply though, so some custom CSS may not override all theme settings. The Show CSS feature in the Style tab can be used by custom CSS developers to understand the CSS that is being generated by the theme.

To quickly remove all data from an application, on the Manage page, choose to Export your application without including submitted data and then choose to Upgrade your application and select the option to Replace submitted data . Prior to performing a large bulk data import into an application that already has submitted data, creating a backup of the application and all existing records is recommended. On the Manage page, select the Export operation for your application and be sure to select the option to Include submitted data . This will provide an archive of the application and data in the state it was in just prior to the import.

Additional parameters follow an ampersand. For example: https://server.com?this=1&that=2, where this is the first parameter, and that is the second parameter. When you make a parameter assignable, the parameter value is replaced at runtime. In the example https://server.com?this=1&that=2, if this is assignable, the value of this is replaced with the mapped input value from the form. For example:https://server.com?this=AAAAA&that=2, where AAAAA is the value from the form. URL segments are path elements within a URL. For example https://server.com/resources/identifier, where resources is the first segment, and identifier is the second segment. When you make a segment assignable, the segment is replaced at runtime. In the example https://server.com/resources/identifier, assigning identifier a value of 1234 results in a URL that reads: https://server.com/resources/1234.

The Leap has an extensible services architecture which allows Leap applications to send and receive data from any external system. The Services Architecture consists of the following components: Service Transports \u2013 The Service Transport is the Java\u2122 code responsible for communicating with an external service, such as a public REST service. It can send data out to the external service or receive data from the external service. The transport also uses JDBC to store and retrieve data from any database. Alternatively, the transport can simply implement a \u201cservice\u201d itself, such as a unit conversion library. You can add any custom transport installation to the Leap installation by placing an appropriate JAR file in a specific directory on the Leap server; however, Leap already includes a generic HTTP transport which can send and receive data over the internet or intranet, and will suffice for many use cases. For more information, see Service Description . Service Descriptions \u2013 The Service Description provides the interface for a Service Transport. A Service Description is usually described by an XML file, although it is also possible to programmatically create a Service Description. The Service Description specifies a service's name, description, input parameters, and output parameters. These attributes are what appear to the application designer when they are hooking up services to a Leap application. Data Mapping \u2013 Each service description can contain an optional \u201cmapping\u201d component which describes how the data coming from the Service Transport can be mapped to the outputs defined in the Service Description, or vice versa. The advantage of the mapping component is that it allows multiple Service Descriptions, each with its own name, description, input, and outputs to use to use the same generic transport. By using XPath-like references, the mapping component supports the mapping of complex data structures such as an XML document. The mapping of constant values is also supported. Service Configuration \u2013 The Service Configuration is another layer of mapping meant for application designers. It maps items in the form to the inputs and outputs of the Service Description. The application designer is responsible for creating service configurations and connecting form items to the service inputs and outputs. Service configurations are stored inside the application. Supporting documents Use the following documents to gain a better understanding of the steps required to expose a service to Leap. Understanding the HTTP transport \u2013 The HTTP Service Transport provides a mechanism to communicate with HTTP servers. The transport allows configuration of the URL to request, HTTP method to use, query parameters, and request headers. When combined with the service mapping engine of Leap, the HTTP Service Transport can extract data from an HTTP response and make it available to your application. The HTTP Service Transport can be used to communicate with any standard HTTP server. While there are some limits on the capabilities of the HTTP Service Transport, it is all that is needed to communicate with a basic HTTP server, or RESTful service, in most cases.

You can use another application to provide data to populate a drop-down menu on your form. Or, you can search a list of products that are maintained by another application. The ability to share data is a powerful feature of Leap. To use an application as a service, the designer of an application must set the requisite permissions on the Access tab of the application. Access can be set for Read , or Read/Write . If you set Read access, other applications are able to Retrieve and Search information from a specific application. If you set Read/Write access, other applications are able to Retrieve, Search, Delete, and Submit information to and from a specific application. For more information about setting permissions, see Defining permissions to share data with other applications . Note: When you use another Leap application as a service, mandatory items must be explicitly mapped in the service mapping Inputs and Outputs. Default Items in the form do not satisfy the mandatory requirement as they are not evaluated on the server. If any value is marked as mandatory, it must have a value that is mapped to it in the mappings dialog. When mapping input parameters, each target has a Search Operator that can change how the inputs are interpreted. For example, you can apply a search operator to create an assignment that links the input with the target, and the operator. To apply the operator, you have to set the View to constant and then type the operator keyword in the editable field. The following table contains the list of available search operators. Search Operators Description equals Equal to notequals Not equal to lt Less than lte Less than or equal to gt Greater than gte Greater than or equal to Endswith The target ends with Startswith The target starts with contains The target contains The services also provide access to metadata about the records, such as author, creation time, and the current stage. When you call these services, metadata can be used to filter the results. The search results can be sorted by form data, such as a field in an application, or by some metadata, such as the lastUpdated time. The default sort order is ascending. To change it to descending, you must prefix your sort field with \u201cDESC\u201d. For example, the following string sorts ascending, \"F_Name\" . The following string sorts descending, \"DESCF_Name\" . The following values are available for you to use when you are searching with metadata: Metadata field Sort key Last update time \"lastUpdated\" Author name \"itemAuthor\" Stage name \"flowState\" Line ID \"dbId\" You can also limit the results by setting a Page Size that limits how many entries you return, or a Page, which limits pages to return. If you do not provide paging values, then all records that meet your filters are returned. To see the list of applications available as services select the HCL Leap Applications entry in the Service Catalog list. A list of all applications and methods available for Service mapping is shown. Each application can expose the following methods that are based on Access settings: Retrieve : Use Retrieve retrieve a single record from another application. For example, use Retrieve to pre-populate information that is based on an employee serial number that is entered by the user into the form. The retrieve returns a single row, and cannot be mapped to a repeating or list item. Search : Use Search to return a list of records from another application that meets the search criteria. For example, use Search to populate a drop-down with a list of values from another Leap application. The results from a search must be mapped to a repeating/list, drop-down, or table item. Delete : When Delete service method is called, it deletes the record in the target application that meets the supplied parameters. Use this method with caution as there is no way to retrieve the data after the record is deleted. Create : The Create method is used to create a record in the target application. Create replicates a user interacting with, and submitting, the target form. Update : The Update method is used to update an existing record in the target application.

The following values are available for you to use when you are searching with metadata: Metadata field Sort key Last update time \"lastUpdated\" Author name \"itemAuthor\" Stage name \"flowState\" Line ID \"dbId\" You can also limit the results by setting a Page Size that limits how many entries you return, or a Page, which limits pages to return. If you do not provide paging values, then all records that meet your filters are returned. To see the list of applications available as services select the HCL Leap Applications entry in the Service Catalog list. A list of all applications and methods available for Service mapping is shown. Each application can expose the following methods that are based on Access settings: Retrieve : Use Retrieve retrieve a single record from another application. For example, use Retrieve to pre-populate information that is based on an employee serial number that is entered by the user into the form. The retrieve returns a single row, and cannot be mapped to a repeating or list item. Search : Use Search to return a list of records from another application that meets the search criteria. For example, use Search to populate a drop-down with a list of values from another Leap application. The results from a search must be mapped to a repeating/list, drop-down, or table item. Delete : When Delete service method is called, it deletes the record in the target application that meets the supplied parameters. Use this method with caution as there is no way to retrieve the data after the record is deleted. Create : The Create method is used to create a record in the target application. Create replicates a user interacting with, and submitting, the target form. Update : The Update method is used to update an existing record in the target application. Update replicates a user interacting with, and submitting changes to a record in the target form Parent topic: Incorporating web services into your applications","title":"Integrating your application with existing HCL Leap applications"},{"location":"cr_viewing_submitted_responses.html","text":"Viewing submitted responses After users complete and submit forms, you can view the submitted responses.

Access is configured when the application is created. The same access permissions that allow users to view and edit the form are used to display submitted results. The following list is a Summary of page chart features: Display type \u2013 By default, charts are displayed as pie charts. You can select to have the chart display as a bar chart. Selecting which charts to display \u2013 The Summary page displays charts for the first 10 form items in a form. If your form contains more than 10 items that can be displayed as charts, click Customize to add or remove form items from the Summary page. Selected charts are remembered as a personal setting from session to session and are also reflected in the distributed Share URLs. What a chart means \u2013 The question on which the results are based is displayed with each chart. If the form item charted is a survey, the survey title is displayed with each of the survey questions. Displaying choice results \u2013 Charts display the most popular 10 answers for a question. If there are more than 10 choices available to a user, the most popular 9 are displayed and the rest of the responses are grouped into an Other category. Displaying numerical results \u2013 If the form item requests a numerical value from the user, the first 10 values are displayed. If there are more than 10 submitted responses, the numerical values are grouped into Ranges . Although the range is automatically determined, some decisions for the range are based on form item configuration when the application is designed. Filtering data \u2013 You can filter the results that are displayed in the charts by clicking Filters and setting parameters. The charts display only the filtered results. Clearing the filters returns the original data set. You can also quickly filter data by clicking a section of the chart. The filter that results from the click is presented in the search dialog prior to application. Filters are applied to the overall set of submitted records and are therefore reflected in all charts. Filters are remembered as a personal setting from session to session, and are also reflected in any distributed Share URLs. Note that Filtering and Quick Filtering is not supported for the Select Many form item. Sharing charts \u2013 You can share the complete set of charts or individual charts by clicking Share . From the Share options, select whether to email or embed the URL of the chart. When you share a chart, the chart information is not static, and will continue to reflect new submissions. Any filters applied to the charts are also included when the chart URL is shared. Note: When you share charts, the people to whom you send the chart URL must have appropriate access permissions. Otherwise, an error message rather than the chart is displayed. iFrame embedding of charts \u2013 You can share charts by embedding the charts into an iFrame. You can use the embedding feature to show a chart on your own HTML page, or with an iFrame capable Portlet, such as the Web Clipping portlet. The iFrame content is also used to host the chart in a Leap application using the HTML form item. Statistical data provided \u2013 Each chart displays the number of times the question was answered from the total number of submitted responses. If questions in your form are not mandatory, you can see how many people answered the question, and how many did not answer the question. Charts that are based on Number or Currency form items display statistical data, such as the minimum, maximum, range, and average of the submitted values.

These options could be hardcoded in the custom widget, or defined by the app author. Widget Instantiation The widget instantiate() function is called when an instance of the custom widget needs to be created. The function is expected to return an object that allows Leap to interact with the instantiated widget. Validation Some intrinsic validation will be done according to the type and constraints declared in the widget's datatype property; however, it might be necessary for a widget to supply its own custom validation logic.

Selecting PDF types : PDFs must allow the input of information to be populated by data that is collected in a Leap application. Adobe\u2122 Acrobat Pro is the primary tool that is used for creating PDFs where you can complete fields, and can be used to reliably create or modify existing PDFs to make them compatible with the Leap document integration feature. In some cases, Adobe Acrobat Reader extensions are removed by Reader after the document is populated. XFA PDFs have partial support when they have \u201ccompatibility mode\u201d enabled. Encrypted PDFs cannot be populated. Some PDF documents are intended only for printing and have no data entry fields. These PDFs cannot be populated. A number of freely available PDF authoring tools on the web do not create compatible PDFs. Some PDF documents that are created or modified with these tools might appear to have direct text entry support but do not allow completion of fields. If a PDF has limitations that make it unusable for populating with data from Leap, you can still attach the PDF to the form and it is returned unmodified. This is useful if you want to return a static PDF containing detailed instructions. Populating fields in a signed PDF document results in a validation warning message that is displayed by the PDF Reader. The warning message tells users unsigned changes were added after the document was signed. When you work with languages that contain extended character sets, be sure to match the language of the Leap form with the Language/Font of the PDF item. Any character or glyph that is missing from a font is omitted from the value that is passed. The built-in PDF viewer on iOS/Safari does not properly render values of filled PDF's. This is an iOS/Safari limitation. Mapping information : Values can be mapped to PDF Text Fields that are marked as readonly. You can populate a PDF from values that are collected in the Leap form, while the PDF remains unmodifiable through direct entry. The design time exercise of creating a map to indicate how data moves from application to the PDF are made much easier when items on both sides are properly named. When you use the Leap mapping dialog, if items in the PDF do not have recognizable names, Adobe Acrobat Pro can be used to modify the PDF. Take care to understand the format and constraints of the item you are mapping to and from. In some cases, a poorly matched map results in a blank item in the PDF because no value is mapped. For example, mapping a Number into a PDF Date Text Field , or mapping multiple selections from a Select Many choice item into a PDF Radio Group . In other cases, a value appears in the PDF but might result in constraint violations within the PDF. For example, mapping an unconstrained Single-Line Entry into a PDF Field . Multi-lined values cannot be mapped to single lined text fields in a PDF. The Export Values for PDF choice type items can be determined by inspecting the PDF with an editing tool. The Export Values are also displayed as part of the Description property in the extra information hover text within the Leap mapping dialog. To see the Export Values , hover over the information icon next to any PDF item in the list to be mapped. For a successful map, the Saved Value for the Leap item should be adjusted to match the Export Value . To map choice items, the Saved Value for the selected choice must match the Export Value for the available choice in the PDF item. The Export Value is used as an indicator of whether a particular choice in the item is marked as selected, or turned \u201con\u201d. This note is applicable to Leap choice items such as Select One , Select Many , Drop Down , Survey , and Choice Slider . When you map a Check Box to a PDF Check Box , the Export Value is automatically determined so no special consideration needs to be made around matching the Export Value. Select Many A Select Many can be mapped into a PDF Radio Group . However, configure the Select Many with a constraint that allows only one choice selection so the constraints of the PDF Radio Group are not violated A Select Many should not be mapped to a cluster of PDF Check Boxes if the PDF Check Boxes do not have unique Export Values . In this case, the Leap form might need to be altered to replace the Select Many item with a cluster of individual Checkboxes . A Select Many maps well to a PDF List Box Multi-Select but can also be mapped to a cluster of PDF Check Boxes by creating multiple maps. One map from the Select Many to each Check Box in the cluster. When mapping from a Select Many to a PDF Check Box , the Saved Value of a selected choice must match the Export Value of the PDF Check Box for the PDF check box to be turned on. Each question in a Survey must be mapped separately, and must use the same rules for mapping as a Select One or Select Many . Leap tables are repeating rows of data and cannot be mapped directly into a PDF. Some Leap items that cannot be mapped are Image , HTML Fragments , Text , Button , Line , Media , Web Link , Attachment , Page Navigation , Section , and Tabbed Folder . Some PDF items that cannot be mapped are Button , Digital Signature , Image , and Text .

Populating fields in a signed PDF document results in a validation warning message that is displayed by the PDF Reader. The warning message tells users unsigned changes were added after the document was signed. When you work with languages that contain extended character sets, be sure to match the language of the Leap form with the Language/Font of the PDF item. Any character or glyph that is missing from a font is omitted from the value that is passed. The built-in PDF viewer on iOS/Safari does not properly render values of filled PDF's. This is an iOS/Safari limitation. Mapping information : Values can be mapped to PDF Text Fields that are marked as readonly. You can populate a PDF from values that are collected in the Leap form, while the PDF remains unmodifiable through direct entry. The design time exercise of creating a map to indicate how data moves from application to the PDF are made much easier when items on both sides are properly named. When you use the Leap mapping dialog, if items in the PDF do not have recognizable names, Adobe Acrobat Pro can be used to modify the PDF. Take care to understand the format and constraints of the item you are mapping to and from. In some cases, a poorly matched map results in a blank item in the PDF because no value is mapped. For example, mapping a Number into a PDF Date Text Field , or mapping multiple selections from a Select Many choice item into a PDF Radio Group . In other cases, a value appears in the PDF but might result in constraint violations within the PDF. For example, mapping an unconstrained Single-Line Entry into a PDF Field . Multi-lined values cannot be mapped to single lined text fields in a PDF. The Export Values for PDF choice type items can be determined by inspecting the PDF with an editing tool. The Export Values are also displayed as part of the Description property in the extra information hover text within the Leap mapping dialog. To see the Export Values , hover over the information icon next to any PDF item in the list to be mapped. For a successful map, the Saved Value for the Leap item should be adjusted to match the Export Value . To map choice items, the Saved Value for the selected choice must match the Export Value for the available choice in the PDF item. The Export Value is used as an indicator of whether a particular choice in the item is marked as selected, or turned \u201con\u201d. This note is applicable to Leap choice items such as Select One , Select Many , Drop Down , Survey , and Choice Slider . When you map a Check Box to a PDF Check Box , the Export Value is automatically determined so no special consideration needs to be made around matching the Export Value. Select Many A Select Many can be mapped into a PDF Radio Group . However, configure the Select Many with a constraint that allows only one choice selection so the constraints of the PDF Radio Group are not violated A Select Many should not be mapped to a cluster of PDF Check Boxes if the PDF Check Boxes do not have unique Export Values . In this case, the Leap form might need to be altered to replace the Select Many item with a cluster of individual Checkboxes . A Select Many maps well to a PDF List Box Multi-Select but can also be mapped to a cluster of PDF Check Boxes by creating multiple maps. One map from the Select Many to each Check Box in the cluster. When mapping from a Select Many to a PDF Check Box , the Saved Value of a selected choice must match the Export Value of the PDF Check Box for the PDF check box to be turned on. Each question in a Survey must be mapped separately, and must use the same rules for mapping as a Select One or Select Many . Leap tables are repeating rows of data and cannot be mapped directly into a PDF. Some Leap items that cannot be mapped are Image , HTML Fragments , Text , Button , Line , Media , Web Link , Attachment , Page Navigation , Section , and Tabbed Folder . Some PDF items that cannot be mapped are Button , Digital Signature , Image , and Text .

Adding services The following topics describe how to add services to your Leap applications.","title":"Extending"},{"location":"get_overview.html","text":"What is HCL Leap, and how is it used? This document provides an overview of the three main activities that are involved in using Leap. There are three main activities that are involved in using Leap: Building forms Publishing applications Reviewing submissions Forms and Applications Throughout the Leap documentation, the words form and application are both used to describe the output that is created by Leap. Forms are a single page, or collection of pages, that create the user interface with which people interact. When a form is combined with workflow, presentation logic and other elements of the Leap technology, it becomes an application. Applications gather the submitted input and automatically store the submissions in a database. Building forms When you start Leap, you are shown a screen with two tabs on the Forms toolbar: Use and Manage. The Use tab shows a list of all applications that are created by other users to which you have access. The Manage tab is where you create and manage applications. When Leap opens, you are shown the Manage tab, which displays any applications you created, or for which you have edit permissions. To create an application, click New Application , enter a descriptive application name, and select Create . A blank form is displayed. Drag items from the Palette and drop them onto the form. As you add items, you can change the default name of each item directly on the form. Click the name of the widget on the canvas to edit the name. A built-in grid automatically aligns items on the form, and expands vertically when you add items to the form. The default layout is two columns and two rows. However, you have flexibility when you build your form. You can stretch one form item to span across all columns, and you can add and delete columns and rows as needed. Click any border of a column or row to access a menu with options for expanding or contracting your form. When you click the Rules icon, you can create rules for form items or for other objects. You can set a rule to show or hide a form item, page, or other object that is based on user input. Some form items must be edited by changing their properties. For example, you can add the survey questions on the form, but the question titles can be edited only in the properties panel. When an item is selected the properties panel appears on the side of the screen. There are many tabs within the properties panel where you can set various functions. For example: Properties tab : Edit properties such as whether the title of a form item appears on the form. The properties that are displayed vary based on the form item. Event tab : Define an event that happens based on user input, such as when the user selects a particular option. Formula tab : Create mathematical expressions to calculate field values and validate form data. Adding workflow elements to a form There are many cases where adding separate steps and restricting user access to part of a form makes the form more useful. For example, you can create a vacation request form that requires the approval of a supervisor, or an award nomination form that requires the approval of both a supervisor and a nomination committee. In the survey form example, the results from the survey are useful feedback, but by adding workflow elements, the curriculum supervisor can review comments before sending them to the instructor. Adding workflow elements is done with Roles and Stages. Adding or editing Roles is done in the Access or Workflow tab. Adding stages is done in the Workflow tab. Roles \u2013 You can create various roles with different levels of access to different information within an application. For example, you can specify that only an administrator can change an application, managers can review submitted data, and users can complete and submit the form. After roles are defined, you can assign users to the roles. Each role can have as many or as few people assigned to it as needed. You can even assign groups to a role. For example, all supervisors are assigned to one role, and all managers are assigned to another role. In the Access tab, each role can either be Open or Closed. If you have a web service, which pre-populates the role information, select Open . For example, you want to use a web service to scan the company email directory and automatically populate the name of the manager. If you do not plan to use web services in your application, leave the role Closed . The user must enter the name of the manager manually when they complete the form. Stages \u2013 Stages are the steps that a form goes through in its lifecycle. For example, in one stage the user submits data. In the next stage, the manager reviews and approves or rejects the submitted data. An application can have as many stages as needed. Stages are also useful as they allow a submitter to save a draft version of the form. For example, on a census form that has multiple pages, the submitter might not have time to complete the whole form in one session. With the Draft button, the user can complete part of the census, save a draft, then return to complete the census later. A stage can hide or display information that is necessary for one user, but not required for another. For example, in our survey form, the curriculum supervisor must see the name of who submitted the feedback. However, to allow for anonymous feedback, the user's name is hidden when the feedback is forwarded from the curriculum supervisor to the course instructor. By default, every form has a Start and Submitted stage. The Start stage is the first stage of every form. The Submitted stage can be modified and other stages added. To create a workflow, add stages in the Workflow tab. You may hover over the stage and click the plus icon, or click on \u201c+ Add Stage\u201d in the properties pane. When a new stage is added, you can modify its properties to build the form workflow as needed. For example, you can add a stage to a survey that thanks the user for submitting feedback and sends the curriculum supervisor an email that indicates that new feedback is available. After the feedback is reviewed by the supervisor, another stage can be added to block the user's name and company information and then forward the feedback to the course instructor. At any time during the form building process, you can save and preview your work in a web browser by clicking Preview . Ensure that your browser does not block pop-up windows because the preview form opens in a new window. The Submit and Cancel buttons are automatically added to your form, and are displayed when you preview the form. Deploying your application When you complete building your form and adding workflow elements, you must deploy your application to make it available to users. Deploying applications is done in the Manage tab. To deploy your application, click Deploy . A menu of deployment options is available. You can set your application to have a specific start and end date, and provide a custom message to instruct users when the application is unavailable. After an application is deployed, you can provide the URL link to your users. You can also get the URL to the application by clicking Launch and copying the address in the web browser. If you must change a form after it is deployed, you can do so at any time. However, you must deploy the form again after you complete your changes. Reviewing submitted data responses When users access the application and submit results, the form author, administrator, or other roles with appropriate access can view the submitted results. In the Manage tab, each application has a View Data link. When the View Data link is clicked, you can choose to analyze submitted responses by viewing summary charts or response records. The Summary screen displays the survey results in customizable charts. The View Data screen displays all submitted responses in a table. You can sort the submitted results by clicking any of the column titles. Selecting a response displays the submitted data in a new window. Forms that have extra stages have extra buttons in the View Data screen. For example, the curriculum supervisor has a button to accept the feedback, which forwards the feedback to the course instructor. In another example, such as a vacation request form, the manager can either accept or reject the vacation request. If the manager accepts the request, the request is forwarded to Human Resources to log against the available vacation days. In all cases, an email with the decision of the supervisor is sent to the employee. You also can export all data to a spreadsheet program, such as Open Office, or Microsoft\u2122 Excel.

Supported languages Leap supports the following languages: Arabic Catalan Chinese (Simplified) Chinese (Traditional) Croatian (Croatia) Czech (Czech Republic) Danish (Denmark) Dutch English Finnish (Finland) French German Greek Hebrew Hungarian (Hungary) Italian Japanese (Japan) Kazakh Korean (South Korea) Norwegian Bokm\u00e5l (Norway) Polish Portuguese (Brazil) Portuguese (Portugal) Romanian (Romania) Russian (Russian) Slovak Slovenian (Slovenia) Spanish Swedish (Sweden) Thai Turkish (Turkey) The default language for designing applications is based on your web browser locale, or WebSphere\u00ae Portal container. If you do not want to use your default language, you can change to a specific language, or select \u201cUser\u2019s Language\u201d so the application applies the user\u2019s web browser language settings when the application is opened. Formatting Form items, such as currency, date, and time, are based on the locale of the form. For example, if a currency item is set on a form with a locale of Germany, the currency is shown as Euros. It is important to note that no monetary conversion is done if the locale of the form changes. The format of the currency symbol on the form changes, but the amount entered is shown as entered. For example, if a user enters $100 into a currency field with a locale of United States, the currency is shown as $100 US on a form with a locale of Germany. You can edit the currency type, with the Currency field selected, in the Properties side panel. Locale settings can also affect dates. Countries can have specific requirements for how dates are written. For example, one country might want a date written month/day/year: 06/29/2012. While another country has a standard of day/month/date/year: Friday June 29, 2012. How the date is shown is determined by the locale of the form.

Configuring Leap with OIDC Leap can be configured to leverage OpenID Connect (OIDC) as the primary authentication mechanism. This means that Leap will be turned into a Relying Party (RP) to the specified identify provider (IDP). When OIDC is used, the user and group lookup feature of Leap is not available and must be disabled as part of the configuration. The following tasks must be completed to establish this configuration: Configure the OIDC identity provider. Create a secret in Kubernetes container from the IDP server certificate. Add an OIDC definition as a server customization. Add configuration properties related to the OIDC configuration. Restart the pod. Configure OIDC identity Provider Many different identity providers offer OIDC capability. Refer to your chosen identity provider's documentation for more details on configuration. Create a secret in Kubernetes container from the IDP certificate As part of the configuration process for your identify provider, you will have created or obtained a digital certificate for configuring HTTPS. This certificate will also need to be deployed to Leap so that the two servers can communicate with each other. Note: The SSL certificate (.crt) and public key (.key) should be in PKCS12 format. After copying the .key and .crt to the kubernetes image, create a secret using the following command: kubectl -n myns create secret tls oidccert --key=\"/tmp/oidc.key\" --cert=\"/tmp/oidc.crt\" Next, this secret can be referenced in the yaml file: configuration : leap : customCertificateSecrets : keycloakCert : \"keycloakcert\" For more information, see to Provide admin user a custom secret . Add OIDC definition as a server customization The properties that you need to specify may differ based on your identify provider. For additional information, see the Open Liberty documentation on OpenID Connect . Before moving on from this step: Verify that the discoveryEndpointURL is valid by opening it in a browser prior to entering it in the yaml file. Update the clientSecret with the proper value obtained from your IDP The following snippet is an example of an OIDC definition: configOverrideFiles : openIdConnect : | <server description=\"leapServer\"> <openidConnectClient id=\"oidc\" clientId=\"hcl-leap-oidc-client\" clientSecret=\"clientSecretHash\" signatureAlgorithm=\"RS256\" authFilterRef=\"interceptedAuthFilter\" mapIdentityToRegistryUser=\"false\" httpsRequired=\"true\" scope=\"openid\" <!-- Defines a simple name that can be used to refer to this OIDC config --> realmName=\"LeapOidc\" <!-- The property of the token that contains the user's group assignments --> groupIdentifier=\"group_membership\" userIdentityToCreateSubject=\"preferred_username\" discoveryEndpointUrl=\"https://myoidcserver:8443/realms/Leapdev/.well-known/openid-configuration\"> </openidConnectClient> <authFilter id=\"interceptedAuthFilter\"> <requestUrl id=\"authRequestUrl\" matchType=\"contains\" urlPattern=\"/apps/secure|/apps/secured\"/> </authFilter> <httpEndpoint id=\"defaultHttpEndpoint\" host=\"*\" httpPort=\"9080\" httpsPort=\"9443\"> <samesite none=\"*\" /> </server> For more details on defining a server customization, see Open Liberty server customizations . Add config properties related to OIDC config The following properties must be set to complete the OIDC configuration: userLookups - By setting this to false it will disable user lookups, which is not available when configured with OIDC. userGroups - By setting this to false it will disable group lookups, which is not available when configured with OIDC. postLogoutRedirectURL - This is the URL to which Leap will redirect the browser after a user chooses to log out. This is necessary to complete the loop with the OIDC IDP. configuration : leap : leapProperties : | ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.userLookup=false ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.userGroups=false ibm.nitro.LogoutServlet.postLogoutRedirectURL=https://myoidcServer.com/realms/Leap/protocol/openid- connect/logout?client_id=hcl-leap-oidc-client&post_logout_redirect_uri=https://myLeapServer.com/apps/secure/org/ide/manager.html For more details on setting Leap properties, see Leap properties . Referencing Users and Groups in Security Role Mapping To assign a user or group from OIDC to one of the Leap roles (AdministrativeUsers, EditApplicationUsers, UseApplicationUsers) you must use their access id. The access id is made up of the realmName (defined in the 'openidConnectClient' definition) and the user/group name. To assign a user from OIDC to a Leap security role you would use {realmName}/{userName}: MappedUsersAccessIDs : - LeapOidc/john.oidc To assign a group from OIDC to a Leap security role you would use {realmName}/{groupName}: MappedGroupsAccessIDs : - LeapOidc//Group1 Note: there is an extra slash in the group name because that is part of the definition in the IDP used for this example. Other IDPs may differ in how they define the group name, if in doubt leverage the logging trace string to identify the correct value. Troubleshooting To get more information about how Liberty perceives the logged in user, add the trace string 'com.ibm.ws.security.authentication.*=all'. This will provide useful information for understanding the user and group values. An example output in the trace.log, after logging in, looks like: Principal: WSPrincipal:john.oidc Public Credential: com.ibm.ws.security.credentials.wscred.WSCredentialImpl@cb847b2d,realmName=LeapOidc,securityName=john.oidc,realmSecurityName=LeapOidc/john.oidc,uniqueSecurityName=john.oidc,primaryGroupId=null,accessId=user:LeapOidc/john.oidc,groupIds=[group:LeapOidc//Group2] Private Credential: IDToken:{\"exp\":1710363581,\"iat\":1710363281,\"auth_time\":1710363280,\"jti\":\"f343b1fe-6a9a-482f-a85e-1cf46f4eb1b8\",\"iss\":\"https://myoidcserver:8443/realms/Leapdev\",\"aud\":\"hcl-leap-oidc-client\",\"sub\":\"9b8cd571-5d09-4de2-ba2d-22b985424831\",\"typ\":\"ID\",\"azp\":\"hcl-leap-oidc-client\",\"session_state\":\"fff63a5e-8269-4e69-b4c3-9d4135c028da\",\"at_hash\":\"ePO9yDI6IGdX1iDG17CNWQ\",\"acr\":\"1\",\"sid\":\"fff63a5e-8269-4e69-b4c3-9d4135c028da\",\"group_membership\":[\"/Group2\"],\"email_verified\":false,\"realmName\":\"Leapdev\",\"name\":\"John Oidc\",\"groups\":[\"default-roles-leapdev\",\"offline_access\",\"uma_authorization\"],\"preferred_username\":\"john.oidc\",\"given_name\":\"John\",\"family_name\":\"Oidc\",\"email\":\"john.oidc@acme.com\"} Note: If the groupIds array is empty then the 'openidConnectClient' is not configured properly; the group claim may be missing from the token or the 'groupIdentifier' may not be set to the correct value.

When the container is started, any files in this directory are copied into /opt/openliberty/wlp/usr/servers/defaultServer/misc. To reference files in this directory within your configuration snippets, use ${SERVER_CONFIG_DIR}/misc. In order to pass custom extensions to Leap, create an \"extensions\" directory in this volume. When the container is started, any files in this directory are copied into /opt/openliberty/wlp/usr/servers/defaultServer/extensions. Note: If files are added to this volume while the system is running then it will need to be restarted. A volume specified as \u201cReadWriteOnce\u201d.

These volumes can be directories in your Kubernetes operating system, or a location supplied by a cloud provider. Persistent volume types Important: Ensure that your PersistentVolumes (PVs) are created with the Reclaim Policy set to RETAIN. This allows for the reuse of PVs after a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is deleted. This is important to keep data persisted, for example, between deployments or tests. Refrain from using the Reclaim Policy DELETE unless you have the experience in managing these operations successfully, to avoid unpredictable results. This is not recommended in production use, as deleting PVCs causes the Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster to delete the bound PV as well, thus, deleting all the data on it. ReadWriteOnce (RWO) ReadWriteOnce PVs allow only one pod per volume to perform reading and writing transactions. This means that the data on that PV cannot be shared with other pods and is linked to one pod at a time. ReadWriteMany (RWX) ReadWriteMany PVs support read and write operations by multiple pods. This means the data on that PV can be shared with other pods and can be linked to multiple pods at a time. Configuration parameters To access the PersistentVolumes (PVs) on your cluster, the HCL Leap Kubernetes or OpenShift deployment using Helm creates PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) that binds the PVs to the corresponding pods. Each PVC that Leap requires allows you to configure the following parameters, as shown below. For a PVC of the Leap application: # Persistent Volume Setup volumes: # Persistent Volumes for Leap leap: # RWX PVC shared by all Leap pods - RWX. Used to pass auxiliary binary files to all Pods on startup rwx: storageClassName: \"manual\" requests: storage: \"50Mi\" # Optional volume name to specifically map to volumeName: StorageClassName Depending on your Cluster configuration, you may have configured a specific StorageClass that should be used for your PVs and the PVCs of HCL Leap. This property allows you to enter the name of the StorageClass you want the deployment to use. PVCs then only accepts PVs that match the StorageClassName you have defined in the configuration. If there are no PVs that match, the pods remain pending and do not start until a fitting PV is provided by the cluster. If you enter an empty StorageClassName, Kubernetes falls back to the default StorageClass configured in your Cluster. Refer to your cloud provider for additional information about your default StorageClass, since this depends on your Kubernetes or OpenShift environment. Reference the original values.yaml file you have extracted as outlined in the Prepare configuration topic for all configurable PVCs. Requests Storage. Storage allows you to define the amount of space that is required by the PVC. Once defined, it only accepts PVs that have the same or more storage capacity as requested. If there are no PVs matching the definitions, the pods remain pending and do not start until a properly-sized PV is provided by the cluster. Selector If you want your deployment to pick up specific PVs that you have created, the selector option can be used to match PVs by their labels. A detailed description on how to use the selector can be found in the official Kubernetes documentation. A PVC will only match with a PV satisfying the selector and all the other requirements such as type (RWO/RWX, as defined by the deployment itself), storage capacity, and StorageClassName. VolumeName If you want your deployment to pick up a specific PV that you have created, use of the VolumeName can define that instruction. Ensure that the PV you created has a unique name. Then, add that name as a configuration parameter for the PVC. The PVCs only matches with a PV of that name, matching the other requirements-like type (RWO/RWX, as defined by the deployment itself), storage capacity, and StorageClassName. As a single persistent Volume is assigned using the volumeName, this should only be used for RWX claims or for Pods that are only ever scaled to one replica.

Please refer to the Selector section to select specific PersistentVolumes for multiple claims.

IBM HTTP Server : A standard component of WebSphere\u00ae Application Server that interacts with the application server. Leap Database : The Leap database which contains all applications and data that exist within the Leap environment. If you plan to use Leap with WebSphere Portal, the following diagram describes the basic architecture: The components perform the following functions: Leap : The environment in which you create, deploy and launch applications. IBM HTTP Server : A standard component of WebSphere Application Server that interacts with the application server. Leap Database : The Leap database which contains all applications and data that exist within the Leap environment. Leap Portlet: When installed and configured to point at the Leap server, it enables content to be rendered within a WebSphere Portal environment. User registry : Leap relies on a user registry, such as an LDAP, to manage access to the system. This is connected to the Leap application server.

The nonce is applied as an attribute to all <script> and <style> tags on the page. When using the Embedding API , the product is not in control of the page and therefore needs to be informed of the nonce value in the data-leap-config attribute so that it can load the product\u2019s scripts in a secure manner.

Strict CSP is not applied to any aspects of Leap\u2019s authoring environment. When using the Embedding API, if you want a callback function to be called after the form has been launched, it cannot be specified in the data-leap-config attribute. It must be supplied by providing as a parameter to Leap.launch() function.

In rare cases, some forms may fail to render when Strict CSP is enabled and JavaScript security is enabled (ie. when ibm.nitro.ApplicationCompilerService.secureJS=false is enabled or unset). This depends on the exact product features being used. Errors regarding inline styles will appear in the browser console, however effort has to been made to ensure there are no noticeable side-effects for end-users, with the following exceptions: Styles applied to the content of the Text widget might not be preserved - these would be inline-styles and therefore not allowed by the browser in Strict CSP mode.

The configuration file is the heart of your deployment using Helm. It defines how HCL Leap is deployed to supported platforms, and how it behaves during runtime operations. This section explains how to create your own configuration file and how to leverage the existing values.yaml inside the Helm Chart. It also explains how to optionally overwrite settings in case the default set may not be sufficient. Note: Modification to any files (chart.yaml, templates) in hcl-leap-deployment-vX.X.X_XXXXXXXX-XXXX.tar.gz is not supported. The configuration flow Helm provides multiple ways to define values that can be processed to run an installation. Processing involves a three-step approach, that is ordered sequentially within a hierarchy. Helm Chart values.yaml Every Helm Chart contains a values.yaml file. It defines all configurable parameters that a Helm Chart accepts and the default values that are used during an installation. If you do not provide any other configuration during an installation, Helm extracts all deployment information from the values.yaml file inside the Helm Chart. All parameters that were not overwritten using any other configuration methods return to their default values from the values.yaml file inside the Helm Chart. Custom value file Helm provides you with a way to maintain your own custom values files. You can specify a custom values file you want to use when running an installation. This custom values file only needs to contain the parameters that you want to overwrite with your preferred settings. Note: There is no need to have the same complete set of parameters inside your custom values file, as there are available by default in the Helm Chart values.yaml. As outlined previously in this section, everything that is not defined in your custom values file are applied using the defaults from values.yaml inside the Helm Charts. Be aware that the parameters you can configure using your custom values file need to exactly align with those provided by the Helm Charts own values.yaml. You cannot configure anything that is not exposed in the values.yaml definition. Override parameters It is possible to define values using a --set parameter in the Helm CLI during the installation of a Helm Chart. Since there are many values that can be configured in the HCL Leap deployment, we do not recommend this technique, since it makes installation commands very large and confusing. The default HCL Leap Container values.yaml file HCL Leap Helm Chart provides a default values.yaml, which contains all possible configuration parameters. To access this file, you may use the following command when you have the HCL Leap or later Helm Chart tar.gz file on hand: # Command to show values from Helm Chart helm show values hcl-leap-deployment.tar.gz What appears in the console is all the configurable parameters and their default values. A custom configuration file Helm allows you to provide a custom configuration file during the installation or upgrade process. That file only overwrites settings that are defined within it. For parts of the configuration that are not defined in your custom configuration file, Helm returns to the default values in the values.yaml file inside the Leap Helm Chart. This allows you to keep the overall size of your configuration file small and the maintainability high. This documentation refers to the custom configuration file as custom-values.yaml. You may name your custom configuration file as preferred. Note: Including all of the parameters from the values.yaml is not necessary and may bloat your configuration file with values that are already present in the Leap Helm Chart. Only specify what you want to change from its default value.

Usage details Your custom CSS is the last style sheet that is applied in an application. However, you must ensure that your CSS rules are more specific (higher weighted) than the ones already specified in the base CSS rules. In some cases, you must append the !important declaration to your rules to override the Leap base rules. For example, to change the font color of all item titles use .lfMn .lfFormLabel {color: #094291 !important} . In some cases you must add the universal, \u201c*\u201d, selector to your rules. For example, to change the font color of all buttons use .lfMn .lfFormBtn * {color: white} To reference image files that are contained within the same application, use a relative URL of ../image/.... For example, to reference the image named background.jpg contained within your application, use url('../image/background.jpg') . For more information about referencing image files within an application, see Managing the files associated with your application Note: Pop-up menus and dialogs are direct childs of the main body, even when they appear to be otherwise. These child menus and dialogs must be styled to match the main body. Best Practices There are no technical limitations to the CSS rules that can be applied to a form; however there are the following best practices: All CSS rules must begin with the .lfMn class selector. This is important for forms that might be shown within the context of another web page, such as in the IBM\u00ae WebSphere\u00ae Portal environment. Base your CSS rules around class names that are prefixed with \u201clf\u201d. For example: lfFormFieldSingleLine. These class names that are likely to remain consistent between Leap releases. Your custom styles are not restricted, so you must be specific with your selectors. Selectors that are too broad affect all aspects of theLeap interface, including all dialogs and all elements within the View Data interface. Your CSS must target the browsers that are supported by Leap. If possible, avoid CSS rules that affect the size and positioning of elements. You might want to specify some custom padding and margins, but it is your responsibility to ensure that no erroneous cropping or extra scroll-bars are displayed. We recommend that you limit your theme to the following properties: background color background image \u2013 typically for background gradients color font font size border \u2013 typically none or one pixel width Styling individual form items Each item on the form is assigned a unique class name. The syntax for this class name is <form id>-<page id>-<item id> . For example, a class name of F_Form1-P_Page1-F_EmailAddress is applied to the item with an ID of F_EmailAddress , on the page with an ID of P_Page1 , on the form with an ID of F_Form1 . You can use these unique class names to style specific items in your application. Note: It is possible that two separate applications each have an item with the same unique class name. Using custom CSS class names You can assign a custom CSS class name to any form, page, item, or stage action button in your application. You can then use the custom CSS class names in your custom theme. Setting custom CSS class names is done in the Properties side panel. Specify the custom class names, which are separated by spaces, in the Custom CSS class names field. Custom class names can also be added to, or removed from, items dynamically with the JavaScript\u2122 API. Testing your custom CSS changes Use a CSS development tool to test your custom CSS changes. Most web browsers contain such a tool, which you can use to discover the wanted styling class. You can even make CSS rule modifications online, so you immediately see how a change affects the form visually. After the rules are determined, copy them to your custom CSS file for uploading into your Leap application. If you do not have access to a CSS development tool, an alternative approach is to place the CSS file on a web server. Reference the web location when you add the CSS file to your Leap application. You can modify the CSS file on the web server, then refresh the Leap application to pick up the changes. This approach quickly tests style changes without requiring you to repeatedly upload a new CSS file into your application, save the application, and then redeploy.

ATOM Feed One type of data to POST when doing a creation is a full ATOM Feed. The data starts with a element and contains one or more <entry> elements. Each <entry> element represents a single record to add to the application. <feed xmlns= \"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\" > <entry> <title type= \"text\" > F_Form1 </title> <updated> 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z </updated> <content type= \"application/xml\" > <F_Form1 xmlns= \"\" form_id= \"2b2c2b58-520a-45c3-8438-8bbaa2f9aaa9\" pressedButton= \"S_Submit\" flowState= \"ST_Start\" > <F_Amount> 19.25 </F_Amount> <F_Name> Brad Walker </F_Name> <F_Age> 40 </F_Age> </F_Form1> </content> </entry> <entry> ... </entry> ... </feed> It is also possible to POST a single stand alone element such as: <entry xmlns= \"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\" > <title type= \"text\" > F_Form1 </title> <updated> 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z </updated> <content type= \"application/xml\" > <F_Form1 xmlns= \"\" pressedButton= \"S_Submit\" flowState= \"ST_Start\" > <F_Amount> 19.25 </F_Amount> <F_Name> Brad Walker </F_Name> <F_Age> 40 </F_Age> </F_Form1> </content> </entry> <title> The ID of the form to which this record is being submitted. <updated> Mandatory, but its value is replaced with a new timestamp by the server. A value of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z can always be used. <content> Contains the submitted data. The structure of the data within the element is different for each application, and is based on the list of form items that were used to create the application. The easiest way to find the complete list of elements is to issue a Retrieve REST call and look at the resulting data. Note : The root element of the submitted data, which in this example is the <F_Form1> element, must be in the null namespace, which is xmlns=\"\" The root element must have the pressedButton and flowState attributes. The flowState is the ID of the current stage of the record. For all Create REST calls, this is always ST_Start , which is the ID of the Start stage. The pressedButton indicates the ID of the stage action submit button, which simulates the submission. A submit button ID must be specified to activate the appropriate stage activities and transfer the record to the next appropriate stage. Upon creation, the new record is assigned a generated unique record UID. This UID can be found in the response data, which is similar to the data returned from a Retrieve action. Response data is only returned when a stand alone <entry> is POSTed rather than multiple entries in a <feed> . JSON You can also POST a JSON payload, for example: { \"uid\" : \"324007a4-a04f-4649-8d22-e6c764313f1f\" , \"pressedButton\" : \"S_Submit\" , \"flowState\" : \"ST_Start\" , \"F_SingleLine1\" : \"Jane\" , \"F_SingleLine2\" : \"Test\" , \"F_Number1\" : 24.25 } Note: The uid is optional.

The structure of the data within the element is different for each application, and is based on the list of form items that were used to create the application. The easiest way to find the complete list of elements is to issue a Retrieve REST call and look at the resulting data. Note : The root element of the submitted data, which in this example is the <F_Form1> element, must be in the null namespace, which is xmlns=\"\" The root element must have the pressedButton and flowState attributes. The flowState is the ID of the current stage of the record. For all Create REST calls, this is always ST_Start , which is the ID of the Start stage. The pressedButton indicates the ID of the stage action submit button, which simulates the submission. A submit button ID must be specified to activate the appropriate stage activities and transfer the record to the next appropriate stage. Upon creation, the new record is assigned a generated unique record UID. This UID can be found in the response data, which is similar to the data returned from a Retrieve action.

Filtering Data REST API results Parent topic: Data access REST API","title":"List"},{"location":"ref_data_rest_api_list_filter.html","text":"Filtering Data REST API results The following information describes how to filter Data REST API results. You can filter the results of the List action by providing extra URL parameters. For example: /apps-basic/secure/org/data/{app-uid}/{form-id}?F_Amount__lt=1000 This sample query would limit results to records whose F_Amount currency field value is less than 1000. The syntax of a single filter parameter is {element}__{operator}={value} , where {element} is the ID of an item in the form, or one of the record metadata properties. For example, the author_name is used to filter by the name of the initial submitter of a record. Note: All filter parameters must be properly URL encoded. Common encoding characters are described as follows: %3A - a colon %20 - a space %2B - the plus sign (+) For example, the colon in a time value of \u201c09:40\u201d would need to be encoded as %3A resulting in an encoded value of 09%3A40 . Two simple examples of single filter parameters are: F_Age__equals=5 author_name__equals=James%20Smith Multiple Filters Multiple filter parameters can be included in a single URL along with a searchOperator parameter. OR In an OR relationship, any one of the filters is true. ?{element1}__{operator1}={value1}&{element2}__{operator2}={value2}&searchOperator=OR AND In an AND relationship, all of the filters must be true. ?{element1}__{operator1}={value1}&{element2}__{operator2}={value2}&searchOperator=AND Note: Only a single searchOperator parameter is supported in a request. You cannot use both AND and OR in a single request. If no searchOperator parameter is present, the default is AND. Metadata properties Each record can use the following properties for filtering.

Metadata filtering properties Element Operator Type Description author_name See the table of String Operators The name of the user that initially created the record. updater_name See the table of String Operators The name of the user that last updated the record. creation_time See the table of Time Stamp Operators The time stamp of when the record was initially created. updated See the table of Time Stamp Operators The time stamp of when the record was last updated flow_state See the table of Stage Operators The ID of the stage that the record is in. For example, \u201cST_End\u201d String Operators String operators are used on the values of the following form items: Single-Line Entry , Multi-Line Entry , Email , Drop Down , Select One , Select Many , Survey question, Choice Slider , and Website . String operators are also used on the following metadata properties: author_nameand updater_name. Table 2. String operators Operator Description equals The value of the element is tested for equality against the specified value. startswith Checks to see whether the value of the element starts with the specified value. endswith Checks to see whether the value of the element ends with the specified value. contains Checks to see whether the value of the element contains the specified value. Number operators Number operators are used on the values of the following form items: Number , Currency , and Numeric Slider . Table 3. Number operators Operator Description equals The value of the element is tested for equality against the specified value. notequals The value of the element is tested for non-equality against the specified value. gt Checks to see whether the value of the element is greater than the specified value. lt Checks to see whether the value of the element is less than the specified value. gte Checks to see whether the value of the element is greater than or equal to the specified value. lte Checks to see whether the value of the element is less than or equal to the specified value. Boolean operator This operator is only used on the value of the Checkbox form item. Table 4. Boolean operator Operator Description equals The value of the element is tested for equality against the specified value. Valid values to compare against are true and false . Time, Date, and Time Stamp operators Time values are valid against Time form items only. Date values are valid against Date form items only. Time stamp values are valid against Time Stamp form items, or the creation_time and updated metadata properties. Time, date, and time stamp values must be provided in ISO 8601 extended format. For example, a time stamp for 21 Dec 2015 10:00 AM Pacific Standard Time must be given as: 2015-12-21T10:00:00-08:00 or 2015-12-21T18:00:00Z. Note: Remember to take daylight savings into account based on the time zone and the date of a time stamp value. For example, 21 June 2015 10:00 AM Pacific Daylight Time must be given as 2015-06-21T10:00:00- 07:00 or 2015-06-21T 17:00 :00Z Dates must be passed in the format yyyy-mm-dd Times must be passed in the format hh:mm:ss Remember that all values must be properly URL encoded. For example, a value of 2015-06-21T17:00:00Z+8:00 must be encoded as 2015-06-21T17%3A00%3A00%2B8%3A00 . Table 5. Time, Date, and Time Stamp operators Operator Description after Filters so that the results provided come after the specified time and date. before Filters so that the results provided come before the specified time and date. between Filters so that the results provided fit on or within the specified times and dates. The between operator takes a value in the following format: {start moment} A*N*D {end moment} For example, to search between the start of day 1 June 2015 and the start of day 8 June 2015 (in Pacific Daylight Time) the value is: 2015-06-01T07:00:01Z >A*N*D 2015-06-08T07:00:01Z Additional Date and Time Stamp operators To adjust for different time zones, use the tzOffset URL parameter. The value is the number of seconds of offset from Coordinated Universal Time. For example, for Pacific Standard Time use tzOffset=-28000 Table 6. Additional Date and Time Stamp operators Operator Description year Filters the results so that the year matches the specified numerical value. month Filters the results so that the month matches the specified numerical value. The value must use the numbers 1-12, where 1 is January and 12 is December. day Filters the results so that the day matches the specified numerical value. The value must use the numbers 1-31, where each numeral matches a day of the month. Stage ID operators Stage operators are used with the value of the flow_state metadata property. Table 7. Stage ID operators Operator Description equals The value of the flow_state is tested for equality against the specified value. notequals The value of the flow_state is tested for non-equality against the specified value. Examples The following parameters are examples of filtering. Each example contains the search parameter and a description of the returned result. This filter returns the first 20 records where the value of the F_Number field is greater than or equal to 5. ?F_Number__gte=5&to=20 This filter returns the first 30 records of where the record was last updated between the start of day June 1, 2015 and the start of day Aug 31, 2015, China Standard Time. ?updated__between=2015-06-01T00%3A00%3A01%2B8%3A00A*N*D2015-08-31T00%3A00%3A01%2B8%3A00&to=30 This filter returns first five records where the value of the F_Currency field is less than 1000 AND the value of the F_Number field is greater than 10. ?F_Currency__lt=1000&F_Number__gt=10&searchOperator=AND&to=5 This filter returns the first 20 records where the value of the F_Number field is less than 5 OR greater than 10. ?F_Number__lt=5&F_Number__gt=10&searchOperator=OR&to=20 Parent topic: List","title":"Filtering Data REST API results"},{"location":"ref_data_rest_api_list_filter.html#filtering-data-rest-api-results","text":"The following information describes how to filter Data REST API results.

This is commonly used in the application onStart , since at this scope the form variable is not defined. var myForm = app . getForm ( 'F_Form1' ); var formBO = myForm . getBO (); formBO . F_SingleLine . setValue ( 'setting the value using code!' ); form.getClasses() Returns an Array of custom class names currently applied to the form. form.getCurrentPage() Gets the currently shown page. If there is no page shown, then null is returned. It is possible, though rarely desirable, to have all pages hidden. var pageShown = form . getCurrentPage (); if ( pageShown === 'F_Page1' ) pageShown . F_Text . setContent ( 'Changing the text of this text item when this page is shown.' ); form.getId() Returns the unique ID within the application of this form. For example, 'F_Form1' . form.getPageIds() Returns an array of the page IDs for the pages in this form. form.getPage(pageId) Returns the page object, page, for the page specified. Returns null if the pageId is invalid. Get the specified page: var thePage = form . getPage ( 'F_Page1' ); If the page exists then, navigate to that page: if ( thePage !== null ) form . selectPage ( 'thePage' ) form.getServiceConfigurationIds() Returns an array of all the IDs for services mapped in this form. var serviceConfigs = form . getServiceConfigurationIds (); form.getServiceConfiguration(serviceId) Gets the service object for a particular service ID. Lookup and execute a service from JavaScript: var service = form . getServiceConfiguration ( 'SC_ServiceConfig' ); service . callService (); form.getStageActions() Returns an array of all the action buttons for the current stage. This includes any hidden action buttons as well. Trigger a specific action using JavaScript: var actions = form . getStageActions () : for ( var i = 0 ; i < actions . length ; i ++ ) { if ( get ( actions , i ). getId () === 'S_Submit' ) { get ( actions , i ). activate (); break ; } } form.getType() Returns a string identifying the object type. For example, 'form' . form.removeClasses(classes) Removes a list of custom class names from the form for dynamic CSS styling. The classes parameter can be a single class name, multiple class names separated by spaces, or an Array of class names. form . removeClasses ( 'emphasized error' ); form.removePageFromNavigation(pageId) Removes the specified page from the navigation list for the form. The page navigation item no longer visits that page when next , or previous is selected, nor can you switch to that page programmatically. If the check is selected, remove page 2 from the navigation: if ( BO . F_Check . getValue ()) form . removePageFromNavigation ( 'P_Page2' ); form.restorePageNavigation(pageId) Restores a previously removed page back into the navigation list for the form. If the check is not selected, restore page 2 into the navigation: if ( ! BO . F_Check . getValue ()) form . restorePageNavigation ( 'P_Page2' ); form.selectPage(pageId) Switches to the specified page. If the page is removed from navigation by Stages, Rules, or JavaScript, then you cannot select it. Get the specified page: var thePage = form . getPage ( 'F_Page1' ); If the page exists then navigate to that page: if ( thePage !== null ) form . selectPage ( 'F_Page1' ); Parent topic: Interface objects","title":"Form objects"},{"location":"ref_item_objects.html","text":"Item objects Note: The item.setTitle parameter is not applicable to Tabbed Folder form items.

This option has no effect on items that cannot have focus, are invisible, or are read-only. item.setHintText(pValue) apItem.setHintText(pValue) Takes a pValue string. This method sets the text that is used for hover text on input items. If an empty value is provided, the hint text area is removed. item.setHoverText(pValue) apItem.setHoverText(pValue) Takes a pValue string. This method sets the text that is used for Hint text on input items. If an empty value is provided, no hover help is displayed. apItem.setRequired(required) You can override non-required data to be required with this method. Passing true causes its data to be required and prevents submission if it is not set. Setting the valid to false clears any previously overridden value. item.setRows(pValue) Takes a pValue number.

Setting the valid to true clears any previously overridden valid value. item.setValue(pValue) apItem.setValue(pValue) Sets the value of this data item. The correct data type should be provided based on the Business Object Attribute\u2019s type. Some type conversion is done where possible, for example, a Number converted to a String. Note: The attachment data takes an object with a uid property, an id property, and a filename property. Modifying attachment data is not recommended in most circumstances. item.setVisible(visible) apItem.setVisible(visible) Sets whether this item is visible. Note: If this item is made invisible by a rule or stage, or because a parent is hidden, then you cannot unhide it by calling this function. apItem.validate() Triggers the validation of the data item. item.getColumnHeaders() Returns a JSON object that contains the id, title and width of each header displayed for the table. Sample JSON output: [ { id : \"F_Currency1\" , title : \"La Currency\" , width : 20 }, { id : \"F_Date1\" , title : \"La Date\" } ] var headers = page . F_Table1 . getColumnHeaders (); for ( var h in headers ) { alert ( \"ID=\" + get ( headers , h ). id + \", title=\" + get ( headers , h ). title + \", width=\" + get ( headers , h ). width ); } item.setColumnHeaders(headers) Function accepts a JSON object that can be used to set the id, title and width of each column in the table. This is helpful, for example, to change the language of the column header displayed. var headers = new Array (); set ( headers , 0 , { id : \"F_Currency1\" , title : \"La Currency\" , width : 20 }); set ( headers , 1 , { id : \"F_Date1\" , title : \"La Date\" }); page . F_Table1 . setColumnHeaders ( headers ); Table 2. Item Object - Drop Down only Object Description item.getOptions() Returns the array of options currently shown in the drop-down.

For bidirectional languages, the order is right-to-left. Example: On the form, a Tabbed folder contains 5 tabs: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue. The default start number of the tabIndex is 0. In our example tabbed folder, the tabIndex number 0 is the Red tab which is furthest left, while 4 is the tab furthest to the right. In a bidirectional language, the order is reversed. Tab 0 is assigned to Blue, which is the tab furthest to the right. item.setTabTitleList (pTitleArray) Updates the titles of tabs within a Tabbed Folder from a list of strings by using a pTitleArray array of string values. The list of tabs is updated respective to the order of strings that are defined in the array. If there are more array values than tabs in the form, the additional values are ignored.

[filter] is an array of filter objects. filterOp is either \"and\" or \"or\" and is required if there is more than one filter. A filter is made up of the following: name: the id of a meta-data attribute or a field of the form configured to the data grid. Note: The field id does not have to be displayed in the data grid. operator: as documented in Filtering Data REST API results . value: the value to search Examples: Set a filter to show records that are older than one week and in the \"ST_Triage\" stage: var now = new Date (); var aWeekAgo = new Date ( now . getTime () - ( 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 )); var filters = [ { name : \"created\" , operator : \"before\" , value : aWeekAgo }, { name : \"stageId\" , operator : \"equals\" , value : \"ST_Triage\" } ]; page . F_DataGrid1 . setFilters ( filters , \"and\" ); Set a filter to show records between two dates, from fields on the same app page as the data grid: var filters = [ { name : \"F_BirthDate\" , operator : \"between\" , value : [ appPage . F_StartDate . getValue (), appPage . F_EndDate . getValue ()] } ]; appPage . F_DataGrid2 . setFilters ( filters , \"and\" ); Remove all filters: appPage .

Setting the valid to true clears any previously overridden valid value. item.setValue(pValue) apItem.setValue(pValue) Sets the value of this data item. The correct data type should be provided based on the Business Object Attribute\u2019s type. Some type conversion is done where possible, for example, a Number converted to a String. Note: The attachment data takes an object with a uid property, an id property, and a filename property. Modifying attachment data is not recommended in most circumstances. item.setVisible(visible) apItem.setVisible(visible) Sets whether this item is visible. Note: If this item is made invisible by a rule or stage, or because a parent is hidden, then you cannot unhide it by calling this function. apItem.validate() Triggers the validation of the data item. item.getColumnHeaders() Returns a JSON object that contains the id, title and width of each header displayed for the table. Sample JSON output: [ { id : \"F_Currency1\" , title : \"La Currency\" , width : 20 }, { id : \"F_Date1\" , title : \"La Date\" } ] var headers = page . F_Table1 . getColumnHeaders (); for ( var h in headers ) { alert ( \"ID=\" + get ( headers , h ). id + \", title=\" + get ( headers , h ). title + \", width=\" + get ( headers , h ). width ); } item.setColumnHeaders(headers) Function accepts a JSON object that can be used to set the id, title and width of each column in the table. This is helpful, for example, to change the language of the column header displayed. var headers = new Array (); set ( headers , 0 , { id : \"F_Currency1\" , title : \"La Currency\" , width : 20 }); set ( headers , 1 , { id : \"F_Date1\" , title : \"La Date\" }); page . F_Table1 . setColumnHeaders ( headers ); Table 2. Item Object - Drop Down only Object Description item.getOptions() Returns the array of options currently shown in the drop-down.

Example: Set 12 into the first item in the currently shown tab: var sel = item . getSelectionIndex (); var tabs = item . getChildren (); var selTab = tabs . get ( sel ); var tabChildren = selTab . getChildren (); tabChildren . get ( 0 ). getBOAttr (). setValue ( 12 ); item.getTabTitleList() Returns an array of all the tab titles in this folder. item.setSelectedTab(tabTitle) Selects the Tab that matches the tabTitle string. item.setTabTitle(tabIndex, pTitle) Updates the title of a tab within a Tabbed Folder by using a tabIndex integer and pTitle string value. tabIndex denotes the location of the tab within the list of available tabs from left-to-right. For bidirectional languages, the order is right-to-left. Example: On the form, a Tabbed folder contains 5 tabs: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue. The default start number of the tabIndex is 0. In our example tabbed folder, the tabIndex number 0 is the Red tab which is furthest left, while 4 is the tab furthest to the right. In a bidirectional language, the order is reversed. Tab 0 is assigned to Blue, which is the tab furthest to the right. item.setTabTitleList (pTitleArray) Updates the titles of tabs within a Tabbed Folder from a list of strings by using a pTitleArray array of string values. The list of tabs is updated respective to the order of strings that are defined in the array. If there are more array values than tabs in the form, the additional values are ignored.

Object: Name Picker Object: Select Many savedValues : An array of all the saved values. displayValues : An array of all the display values. displayString : All the list values provided as a comma-separated string. String: All other items Examples: Render all the row data displayed in the data grid as JSON: appPage . F_Text2 . setContent ( toJson ( appPage . F_DataGrid1 . getDisplayedData (), true )); Calculate the sum of a column from displayed data: var data = appPage . F_DataGrid1 . getDisplayedData (); var sum = 0 ; for ( var d in data ) { var dObj = get ( data , d ); sum += dObj . F_Number1 ; } alert ( \"Sum = \" + sum ); item.isAllDataDisplayed() Returns true if all the submitted data for the form connected to the data grid is rendered on screen in a single page. Example: If all the known data is being displayed, then do something with that data. In this example the sum of a column is calculated: if ( appPage . F_DataGrid1 . isAllDataDisplayed ()) { var allData = appPage . F_DataGrid1 . getDisplayedData (); var sum = 0 ; for ( var d in allData ) { var dObj = get ( allData , d ); sum += dObj . F_Number1 ; } alert ( \"Sum = \" + sum ); } item.isColumnVisible (columnId) Returns true if the specified column is visible in the data grid. Example: appPage . F_DataGrid1 . isColumnVisble ( \"F_SingleLine1\" ); item.refresh() Forces the data grid to reload. For example, a submission with \"apps as a service\" may have been triggered and the content in the data grid is stale. Example: Refresh the data grid after calling a service that changes (i.e. adds to, removes from, or updates) the data to which the data grid is connected: var srv = form . getServiceConfiguration ( 'SC_theService' ); srv . connectEvent ( \"onCallFinished\" , function ( success ) { if ( success ) { try { appPage . F_DataGrid1 . refresh (); } catch ( err ) { alert ( \"SC_theService: \" + err ); } } }); item.selectFirstRow() Selects the first row in the data grid. item.setColumnHeader (columnId, pHeaderValue) Sets the header identified by columnId, to the value provided in pHeaderValue. Example: See above for columnId values. Set the header of a column to another language: appPage . F_DataGrid1 . setColumnHeader ( \"createdBy\" , \"Cr\u00e9\u00e9 par\" ); item.setColumnVisible(columnId, boolVal) Controls the visibility of the column identified by columnId. If boolVal is true, the column is shown. If boolVal is false, the column is hidden. Example: See above for columnId values. Hide a column from the data grid if user is not part of a specific role: var isAdmin = app . getCurrentUserRoles (). contains ( \"Administrator\" ); item . setColumnVisible ( \"F_AdminOnly1\" , isAdmin ); item.resetFilters() Returns the filters to what was specified in the data grid configuration. item.setFilters([filter], filterOp) Set filters for the data grid, this will override any filters specified in the data grid configuration. [filter] is an array of filter objects. filterOp is either \"and\" or \"or\" and is required if there is more than one filter. A filter is made up of the following: name: the id of a meta-data attribute or a field of the form configured to the data grid. Note: The field id does not have to be displayed in the data grid. operator: as documented in Filtering Data REST API results . value: the value to search Examples: Set a filter to show records that are older than one week and in the \"ST_Triage\" stage: var now = new Date (); var aWeekAgo = new Date ( now . getTime () - ( 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 )); var filters = [ { name : \"created\" , operator : \"before\" , value : aWeekAgo }, { name : \"stageId\" , operator : \"equals\" , value : \"ST_Triage\" } ]; page . F_DataGrid1 . setFilters ( filters , \"and\" ); Set a filter to show records between two dates, from fields on the same app page as the data grid: var filters = [ { name : \"F_BirthDate\" , operator : \"between\" , value : [ appPage . F_StartDate . getValue (), appPage . F_EndDate . getValue ()] } ]; appPage . F_DataGrid2 . setFilters ( filters , \"and\" ); Remove all filters: appPage . F_DataGrid1 . setFilters ( null ); Parent topic: Interface objects","title":"Item objects"},{"location":"ref_javascript_api.html","text":"JavaScript API This topic provides details on Leap JavaScript API structure. JavaScript\u2122 API Structure Leap JavaScript API structure. The graphic provides a high-level view of the JavaScript API object structure at run time. The Form interface is created once when the application is loaded into the browser, and is then reused every time form data needs to be displayed. The Form Data Business Object is dynamic and is loaded into the user interface each time a form is loaded or created. Usage Details: This library follows a security protocol as defined in Securing Leap overview . For applications with multiple forms, only the form user interface displayed has a Business Object assigned to it. The other forms are hidden, and do not point to data. Tables point to a data element that is a list of Business Object data instances. These Business Object elements are of the same structure as the Business Objects used for a full form. The sub form that you create for editing the table data works only on one item in this list at a time. When it is not in use, it is hidden and does not point to any data. Interface Model Application : The application is the parent that contains forms. It provides a few useful general functions and can be used to get access to any of the forms. Although you can get access to all the forms, only the form currently being displayed has a data Business Object and can have its user interface modified. Forms : There can be any number of forms in an application. Each form contains one or more pages that contain the items. There is a Business Object for each form that holds the data contained in the form. Pages : Pages contain items that collect and display the information for the form. All items on a page can be accessed as properties directly on the page, for example, page.F_MySingleLineitem.setVisible(false); . Each item is accessed by its ID, which can be found in the composer by opening the item\u2019s Edit Properties dialog and going to the Advanced tab. Items : There are two types of items on a form: those that collect data, for example, Single Line Field and Timestamp, and those that do not, including Image, Text, and Section. Any item that collects data is associated with a Business Object Attribute that contains this data. Data Model Business Object : The Business Object contains all the data for a particular form. This data is contained in a Business Object Attribute for each data item contained in the form. These options can be accessed using the following syntax: BO . F_MySingleLineitem Each Business Object Attribute is accessed by its ID, which is found in the composer by opening the item\u2019s Edit Properties dialog and going to the Advanced tab. Business Object Attribute : Each item that is mapped to data has its own Business Object Attribute. The Business Object Attribute contains this data. Note: Some items do not collect data. These items do not have a corresponding Business Object Attributes in the Business Object. For example: PageNavigation. Running Custom JavaScript \u2013 Events Custom JavaScript is run in response to events in the form. These events can be triggered at the application, form, page, and item level in response to form lifecycle changes, and to user interactions. A list of the events available, and how to interact with the form using them is shown in the following list. Running Custom JavaScript Files Custom JavaScript can also be loaded from attached JavaScript files. Any .js file that is added to the application in the Settings > Files section is automatically loaded into your running application.

Only present for data items BOA.setValue(\"Please enter your Name\"); DATA Table 2. Item Events Event Description onClick Called every time that the item is selected by the user. onHide Called every time that the item is hidden, whether just itself or the entire page. onInvalid (only data items) Called when a data item goes from being valid to invalid. onItemBlur Called when the item is blurred (focus is lost). onItemChange Called when the item data is changed and saved into the Business Object. For some types of items, it occurs when the user tabs or switches focus, for example, when users select Number, Single Line, Multi-Line, and Currency form items. For other items, it occurs every time they make a change, such as Check Box, Survey, or drop-down. Note: You cannot change the value of an item within this event as its value has changed, and it is locked. onItemFocus Called when focus is received by an item. onItemLiveChange (items which can be incrementally changed) Called every time data is entered but not yet updated to the Business Object, such as Number, Single Line, Multi-Line, and Currency. onMouseOut Called every time the mouse moves out of the item bounding area (not including label). onMouseOver Called every time the mouse moves into the item bounding area (not including label). onShow Called every time the item goes from being hidden to being shown, whether from a page flip or because of a rule or JavaScript change. onValid (only data items) Called when a data item goes from being invalid to valid. Table 3. Item Events - Table only Event Description Example onAdd This event is called after an entry is added to the table. The newly added item data is available from the variable itemBO. Add a value from the new row to a subtotal field: var curValue = BO . F_Total . getValue (); curValue += itemBO . F_Price . getValue (); BO . F_Total . setValue ( curValue ); onEdit Called after an existing row is edited by the user. The item that was edited is available from the variable itemBO. onRemove Called after a row is deleted from the table by the user. The item that was deleted is available from the variable itemBO. Table 4. Item Events - Tabbed Folder only Event Description onTabSelected Called after a tab is selected. Table 5. Item Events - Section only Event Description onCollapse Called when the section is collapsed. onExpand Called when the section is expanded.

Table 1. Business Object (BO) The object that contains all the data for an instance of a form. Object Description Example BO.<itemId> Accesses the Business Object Attribute data for an individual item on the form. Set the value of a number item on the form: BO . F_Age . setValue ( 12 ); BO.setValid(valid, msg) Setting valid to \"false\" overrides the validity of the form and prevents submission, showing the user the message provided. Setting valid to \"true\" removes any previous override. However, it will not override other ways in which the form might be invalid. Place this code in the onItemChange event of a field to constrain the input to a specific value. if ( BOA . getValue () < 15 || BOA . getValue () > 35 ) { BOA . setValid ( false , \"The age must be between 16 and 35\" ); } BO.getValid() Returns the current value of the overridden valid state of the form as set by BO.setValid() . BO.isValid() Returns true if every field in the form is valid and false otherwise. This is different from getValid() which returns the overridden valid state of the form as set by BO.setValid(). BO.getInvalidMessages() This function returns an array of the error messages of any invalid fields in the form. If there are no invalid fields, the function returns an empty array. BO.getCurrentStage() Returns the current stage of the form. If the form is in the Submitted stage then show the user a custom message in the onLoad : if ( BO . getCurrentStage () === 'ST_Submitted' ) alert ( 'Reminder: This form is complete and cannot be modified' ); BO.getDataId() Returns the unique ID that represents this data item or will represent it if it has never been submitted. BO.getChildren() Returns a list object that provides access to all the individual Business Object Attribute data. The list object has getLength() function, and get(index) function for accessing the objects in the list. Table 2. Business Object Attribute The object that contains the individual data mapped to items on the form. Object Description Example BOA.getValue() Returns the current value. The type of the returned value depends on the type of item. Boolean: Checkbox Number : Number, Currency, Numeric Slider Date: Date, Time, Timestamp Object: Attachment Multi-Value String: Select Many, Survey Question (when \"Allow selection of multiple values\" checked). Values will be delimited with \"__#__\" String: All other items var s = \"\" ; //string s = BO . F_SingleLine1 . getValue (); s = BO . F_Paragraph1 . getValue (); var n = 0 ; //number or currency n = BO . F_Number1 . getValue (); n = BO . F_Currency1 . getValue (); var d = new Date (); //date or timestamp d = BO .

F_Attachment1 . getValue (); alert ( \"ID: \" + o . id + \", filename: \" + o . fileName + \", uid: \" + o . uid ); BOA.setValue(value) Sets the value of this data item. The correct data type should be provided based on the Business Object Attribute\u2019s type. Some type conversion is done where possible, for example, a Number converted to a String. Note: The attachment data takes an object with a uid property, an id property, and a filename property. Modifying attachment data is not recommended in most circumstances. //string BO . F_SingleLine1 . setValue ( \"Sample String\" ); BO . F_Paragraph1 . setValue ( \"Sample String\" ); //number or currency BO . F_Number1 . setValue ( 25 ); BO .

BOA.getBO() Returns the Business Object for the entire form. BOA.getType() Returns a string that indicates the type of data. For example, string, number, boolean, currency, time, date, timeStamp, or attachment. BOA.connectEvent (eventName, callbackFunction) Used for connecting an event listener to a Business Object Attribute. You can define code to execute when the listener detects that the event is triggered. The only supported event for a Business Object Attribute is onChange . Note: If you connect an event, it must be disconnected using BOA.disconnectEvent(eventHandle). Place this in the onShow event of the field to display a message box when the item changes. var hdl = BOA . connectEvent ( \"onChange\" , function ( newValue ) { alert ( \"Field content is \" + newValue ); BOA . disconnectEvent ( hdl ); }); BOA.disconnectEvent (eventHandle) Disconnects the event handler specified by the passed-in event handle object that was returned by a BOA.connectEvent call. If you create a listener in the event of a form object, you must disconnect it. Otherwise, duplicate listeners are created every time the event is triggered. var hdl = BOA . connectEvent ( \"onChange\" , function ( newValue ) { alert ( \"Field content is \" + newValue ); BOA . disconnectEvent ( hdl ); }); BOA.setValid(valid, msg) You can override valid data to be invalid with this method. By passing \"false\", you cause the data to be invalid, and prevent submission. You can optionally provide a custom error message. Setting the valid to \"true\" clears any previously overridden valid value. Note: You cannot set a Business Object Attribute to valid which actually has invalid data, or is set invalid by a rule. Force the user to enter more than 3 characters for their name by adding this code to the items onItemChange: if ( BOA . getValue (). length < 3 ) BOA . setValid ( false , 'Name must be at least 3 characters' ); else BOA . setValid ( true ); BOA.getValid() Gets a value set previously using setValid(). BOA.setRequired(required) You can override non-required data to be required with this method. By passing \"true\", you cause its data to be required and prevent submission if it is not set. Setting the valid to \"false\" clears any previously overridden value. Note: If a Business Object Attribute has been set as required by a property or by a Rule, you cannot make it \"unrequired\". BOA.getRequired() Gets a value set previously using setRequired(). BOA.isValid() Returns true if the data is valid. Returns false if the data is invalid. BOA.getInvalidMessage() Returns the current error messages for this data, or null if the data is valid. BOA.isRequired() Returns true if this item is required. BOA.isMissing() Returns true if this item is required and it has no value. BOA.validate() Triggers the validation of the data item. Table 3. Business Object List for lists of Business Objects This object contains a list of Business Objects. It provides data to Table items rather than the standard Business Object Attribute. Each entry in the table corresponds to a Business Object in the list. Object Description BOL.getLength() Returns the number of Business Objects in the list. BOL.get(index) Returns the Business Object at the specified index. BOL.createNew() Creates a new empty Business Object ready to be inserted into the list using the add() method. BOL.add(bo) Adds a Business Object of the appropriate type to the list. Can be one created with a call to the createNew() method or removed from the list with a remove() call. BOL.remove(bo) Removes the Business Object from the list. Returns true if successful, false if not. BOL.getId() Returns the ID of this data item that is unique per form. BOL.getType() Returns a string that indicates the type of Business Object List data. BOL.setValid(valid, msg) You can override valid data to be invalid with this method. By passing false, you cause its data to be invalid and prevent submission. You can optionally provide a custom error message. Setting valid to true clears any previously overridden valid value. Note: You cannot set a Business Object List to valid that actually has invalid data, or is set invalid by a rule. BOL.getValid() Gets a value set previously using setValid(). BOL.setRequired(required) You can override non-required data to be required with this method. By passing true, you cause its data to be required and prevent submission if it is not set. Setting the valid to false clears any previously overridden value. Note: If a Business Object Attribute has been set as required by a property or by a Rule, you cannot make it \"unrequired\".

BOA.isMissing() Returns true if this item is required and it has no value. BOA.validate() Triggers the validation of the data item. Table 3. Business Object List for lists of Business Objects This object contains a list of Business Objects. It provides data to Table items rather than the standard Business Object Attribute. Each entry in the table corresponds to a Business Object in the list. Object Description BOL.getLength() Returns the number of Business Objects in the list. BOL.get(index) Returns the Business Object at the specified index. BOL.createNew() Creates a new empty Business Object ready to be inserted into the list using the add() method. BOL.add(bo) Adds a Business Object of the appropriate type to the list. Can be one created with a call to the createNew() method or removed from the list with a remove() call. BOL.remove(bo) Removes the Business Object from the list. Returns true if successful, false if not. BOL.getId() Returns the ID of this data item that is unique per form. BOL.getType() Returns a string that indicates the type of Business Object List data. BOL.setValid(valid, msg) You can override valid data to be invalid with this method. By passing false, you cause its data to be invalid and prevent submission. You can optionally provide a custom error message. Setting valid to true clears any previously overridden valid value. Note: You cannot set a Business Object List to valid that actually has invalid data, or is set invalid by a rule. BOL.getValid() Gets a value set previously using setValid(). BOL.setRequired(required) You can override non-required data to be required with this method. By passing true, you cause its data to be required and prevent submission if it is not set.

Purpose of the Basic Credentials Provider The Basic Credentials Provider provides a mechanism that allows user name and password credentials to be gathered, and provided to a Service Transport. The credentials that are gathered are specific to a single user session with HCL Leap. These credentials are not shared between multiple sessions and are not accessible to other users or administrators of Leap. When to use the Basic Credentials Provider When a Service Description needs a set of credentials and the credentials vary based on the user invoking the service call, use the Basic Credentials Provider. How to Configure the Basic Credentials Provider In general, the Basic Credentials Provider does not need any custom configuration to work. By configuring the Service Description to use the Basic Credentials Provider, Leap collects credentials, and makes them available to the Service Transport configured in the Service Description. Sharing Credentials Between Service Descriptions In some cases, several Service Descriptions might need to share a set of user credentials. Instead of having the user enter their credentials once per service, the Basic Credentials Provider can be configured to allow multiple Service Descriptions to share user-entered credentials using a realm. The realm is a property of the Basic Credentials Provider. Its value is the name of the realm to which entered credentials are associated.

Otherwise, the ServiceCatalog directory is not found. For example, /opt/HCL/Leap/extensions/. If the extensions directory or ServiceCatalog/1 directory does not exist, then the Leap server must be restarted after the directories are created. /opt/HCL/Leap/ is not case-sensitive. When the Leap server starts, the ServiceCatalog directory and its subdirectories are scanned for new, deleted, and changed Service Descriptions. New and changed Service Descriptions are loaded and registered with the Leap server, and become available immediately. Service Descriptions that fail to load, or do not have an appropriate Service Transport registered, are not available. Access to a service description may be given to a specific user, group, or special assignment (i.e. Authenticated, Anonymous, etc). The access control is made up of two parts: who may discover and work with the service while designing an application, and who may run the service. Users or Groups provided must be in the proper format - it is recommended to use the dialog (by clicking the button with the down arrow) when adding permissions. Adding or removing users does not require a server restart, but there will be a short delay before the changes take effect.

Applications might depend on any or all of the parameters for the Service Description, as well as data returned within the Service Description. Therefore, modifying the structure or ID of parameters, or how data is mapped into the parameters, can potentially cause failures within deployed applications. Deleted Service Descriptions are unregistered and immediately become unavailable to any applications, deployed or otherwise. It is critical that before deregistering a Service Description, a check is performed to ensure that there are no applications that are using the Service Description. In general, adding new parameters or mappings and changing names and descriptions does not cause failures.

Parent topic: Service Description","title":"Deploying a Service Description"},{"location":"ref_service_http_service_transport.html","text":"HTTP Service Transport This topic provides reference information on HTTP Service Transports used in HCL Leap. Purpose of the HTTP Service Transport The HTTP Service Transport provides a mechanism to communicate with HTTP servers. The transport allows configuration of the URL to request, HTTP method to use, query parameters, and request headers. When combined with the Leap service mapping engine, the HTTP Service Transport extracts data from an HTTP response and makes it available to your application. When to use the HTTP Service Transport The HTTP Service Transport can be used to communicate with any standard HTTP server. There are some limits on what the HTTP Service Transport can provide, but in most cases, the HTTP Service Transport is all that is required to communicate with a basic HTTP server, or RESTful service. How to use the HTTP Service Transport The HTTP Service Transport has numerous parameters to configure it to talk to many HTTP Servers. In many cases, only a subset of the available parameters is needed. However, all the parameters can be used for any Service Description. The following sections provide a high-level outline of the parameters needed to configure specific parts of your HTTP request. Configuring the Request Method All HTTP requests require a request method, which tells the receiving HTTP server what to do with the request. The HTTP Service Transport supports all the basic HTTP request methods, including: GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE. The HTTP Service Transport supports configuring the HTTP request method with the request-method parameter. If this parameter is missing, or does not contain a valid HTTP request method, then the default, GET is used. Configuring the Request URL A URL is required to make an HTTP request. There is no default for this parameter, so it must be provided to the HTTP Service Transport. There are several parameters that affect how the request URL is built: request-url, request-url-postfix, request-url-postfix-encoded, and two dynamic parameters: request-url-postfix-N and request-url-postfix-N-encoded. The HTTP Service Transport constructs the URL by starting with the value of request-url and appending postfixes. If request-url-postfix is present, its value is appended to the value of request-url. Before appending, the HTTP Service Transport URL encodes the value of request-url-postfix if the request-url-postfix-encoded flag is not present or if its value is anything other than true. Encoding allows values containing characters that are not valid to be placed into the URL without any harm. Choosing to not encode a value allows it to be appended without modification to the URL. For example, consider a Service Description that requires the path to a file as input. Since the path might contain slash (/) characters that must be preserved, then request-url-postfix-encoded is set to true. This instructs the HTTP Service Transport to leave the value alone. However, another Service Description might need to include a text string as a path component. In this case, the slash (/) or any other characters are encoded such that they do not interfere with the path. In this second case, the request-url-postfix-encoded parameter is set to false or omitted from the Service Description. In some cases, having a single postfix does not provide enough flexibility. Therefore, the dynamic parameters request-url-postfix-Nand request-url-postfix-N-encoded are used. The N in each of these parameters refers to its order. During processing, the HTTP Service Transport appends the value of these parameters starting with 0 until it finds a missing parameter. As with the single postfix, encoding is optionally performed on each of the parameters before it is added if the value of the request-url-postfix-N-encoded flag is not present or contains any value other than true. For example, if the Service Description contains parameters called request-url-postfix-0, request-url-postfix-1, and request-url-postfix-3, only request-url-postfix-0 and request-url-postfix-1 are appended to the URL. While building the request URL if a parameter called request-url-postfix is found, the dynamic parameters are ignored. The Service Description developer must make a conscious choice to use these dynamic parameters. Configuring Request Parameters Query parameters are configured using parameters with the prefix request-query-. Text after the prefix is considered to be the name of the query parameter to pass. The value of the query parameter comes from the value of the transport parameter, and is encoded to prevent the URL from being disrupted. All parameters with the request-query- prefix are added to the URL. No guarantees are made as to the order in which the query parameters are added. For example, consider a search service that requires the search criteria term to be passed as a query parameter. In order to communicate with this service, the Service Description must have a parameter called request-query-term. Configuring Request Headers The HTTP Service Transport allows HTTP request headers to be configured using parameters with the prefix request-header-. Text after the prefix is considered to be the name of the header. The value of the request header is the value of the parameter. No escaping or encoding is performed on either the name or value of request headers. Therefore, header configuration must include only characters that are permissible. Configuring the Request Body HTTP allows a body, or entity, to be sent with PUT and POST requests. In order to allow a Service Description to include a request entity, the HTTP Service Transport sends the contents of the request-entity parameter with the request. The contents of this parameter are ignored if the content of request-method is not PUT or POST. Configuring HTTP Authentication The HTTP Service Transport supports HTTP Basic and HTTP Digest authentication schemes. There arethreetwo mechanisms through which the credentials can be configured: hard coded in the Service Description, provided through the Java 2 Connector (J2C) Authentication Credentials provider, or provided at run time through the Basic Credentials Provider. To hard code the credentials that the HTTP Service Transport uses to authenticate, the request-http-auth-username and request-http-auth-password parameters must be available. The values of these parameters are used during any HTTP authentication challenge for either HTTP Basic or HTTP Digest authentication. The HTTP Service Transport performs any hashing required. Therefore, the values of these parameters must be the plain text version of both the user name and password. Credentials can be provided at run time using the Basic Credentials Provider. Refer to the Service Description and Basic Credentials Provider help topic for more information. The HTTP Service Transport only uses credentials provided by the Basic Credentials Provider if the request-http-auth-username and request-http-auth-password parameters are empty. Credentials can be provided using the J2C Authentication Credentials Provider. Refer to the Java 2 Connector (J2C) Authentication Credentials Provider help topic for more information. Note: The HTTP Service transport can only use credentials provided by the Basic Credentials provideror the J2C Authentication Credentials Provider if the request-HTTP-auth-username and request-HTTP-auth-password parameters are empty. In addition to HTTP Basic and HTTP Digest authentication, the HTTP Service Transport supports Single Sign on (SSO) authentication using the Cookie Credentials Provider. In the case where the request made through the HTTP Service Transports needs to passLeap authentication cookies, the Cookie Credentials Provider can be used. In general, the Cookie Credentials Provider is configured to pass the LtpaToken and LtpaToken2 cookies. Consult the Service Description and Cookie Credentials Provider help topics for information. Receiving Response Status Information The HTTP Service Transport ensures that the HTTP status code and message are available for consumption. The HTTP status code, for example, 200, 404, or 500, is available in the outbound response-code parameter. Similarly, the outbound response-message parameter contains the status message returned, for example, OK, Not Found, or Server Error. Receiving Response Headers All the headers that are returned in the HTTP response are made available to the Service Description via dynamic parameters. Each header name is converted to lowercase and appended with response-header-. For example, the content-type header would be available as an outbound parameter called response-header-content-type. The parameter contains the value of the header. In the case where a header contains more than one value, the header values are collapsed into a single comma-separated list. Receiving the Response Body The entire response body, or entity, is made available via the outbound response-entity parameter. Specifying the HTTP Service Transport in a Service Description The HTTP Service Transport can be used by specifying its unique ID as the value of the transportId element of the Service Description. The unique ID of the HTTP Service Transport is: HTTPServiceTransport Supported Credentials Providers The HTTP Service Transport supports the following Credentials Providers: Basic Cookie J2C Transport Parameters Inbound Inbound parameters are provided to the HTTP Service Transport. Table 1. Available Inbound Parameters Name Description Mandatory Type Default request-url Base URL to request. Yes String request-method HTTP verb to use when making the request. Acceptable values are GET, PUT, POST, or DELETE. No String GET request-url-postfix Postfix to append to the value of request-url. No String N/A request-url-postfix-encoded Flag indicating whether the value of request-postfix is encoded. If this parameter is missing or is set to false, the value is URL encoded. Yes Boolean FALSE request-url-postfix-N The N postfix to append to the value of request-url. This parameter is only considered if request-postfix is not present. No String N/A request-url-postfix-N-encoded Flag indicating whether the value of the corresponding request-postfix-N is encoded. If this parameter is missing or set to false, the value is URL encoded. No Boolean FALSE request-header-x The value for the request header x. For example, request-header-accept creates a request header called accept. No String N/A request-query-x The value for the query parameter called x. For example, request-query-term creates a query parameter called term. No String N/A request-entity The body of the request to send. The UTF-8 character set is used. No String N/A Outbound Outbound parameters are returned from the transport as a result of the service invocation. Table 2. Available Outbound Parameters Name Description Type response-code HTTP status code returned by the server. This could be any of the standard values, for example, 200, 400, and 500, or a non-standard code returned by the server. Integer response-message HTTP status message associated with the HTTP status code. The value of this parameter is determined by the server. Generally, this message is a standard status message, for example, OK, Not Found, or Server Error. String response-header-x The value of the response header named x in lowercase. For example, if the response contains the response header Content-Type: text/html then response-header-content-type contains the value text/html. String response-entity The entire response body from the HTTP request. It is assumed that the response uses the UTF-8, or ASCII character set.

In many cases, only a subset of the available parameters is needed. However, all the parameters can be used for any Service Description. The following sections provide a high-level outline of the parameters needed to configure specific parts of your HTTP request. Configuring the Request Method All HTTP requests require a request method, which tells the receiving HTTP server what to do with the request. The HTTP Service Transport supports all the basic HTTP request methods, including: GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE. The HTTP Service Transport supports configuring the HTTP request method with the request-method parameter. If this parameter is missing, or does not contain a valid HTTP request method, then the default, GET is used. Configuring the Request URL A URL is required to make an HTTP request. There is no default for this parameter, so it must be provided to the HTTP Service Transport. There are several parameters that affect how the request URL is built: request-url, request-url-postfix, request-url-postfix-encoded, and two dynamic parameters: request-url-postfix-N and request-url-postfix-N-encoded. The HTTP Service Transport constructs the URL by starting with the value of request-url and appending postfixes. If request-url-postfix is present, its value is appended to the value of request-url. Before appending, the HTTP Service Transport URL encodes the value of request-url-postfix if the request-url-postfix-encoded flag is not present or if its value is anything other than true. Encoding allows values containing characters that are not valid to be placed into the URL without any harm. Choosing to not encode a value allows it to be appended without modification to the URL. For example, consider a Service Description that requires the path to a file as input. Since the path might contain slash (/) characters that must be preserved, then request-url-postfix-encoded is set to true. This instructs the HTTP Service Transport to leave the value alone. However, another Service Description might need to include a text string as a path component. In this case, the slash (/) or any other characters are encoded such that they do not interfere with the path. In this second case, the request-url-postfix-encoded parameter is set to false or omitted from the Service Description. In some cases, having a single postfix does not provide enough flexibility. Therefore, the dynamic parameters request-url-postfix-Nand request-url-postfix-N-encoded are used. The N in each of these parameters refers to its order. During processing, the HTTP Service Transport appends the value of these parameters starting with 0 until it finds a missing parameter. As with the single postfix, encoding is optionally performed on each of the parameters before it is added if the value of the request-url-postfix-N-encoded flag is not present or contains any value other than true. For example, if the Service Description contains parameters called request-url-postfix-0, request-url-postfix-1, and request-url-postfix-3, only request-url-postfix-0 and request-url-postfix-1 are appended to the URL. While building the request URL if a parameter called request-url-postfix is found, the dynamic parameters are ignored.

In order to allow a Service Description to include a request entity, the HTTP Service Transport sends the contents of the request-entity parameter with the request. The contents of this parameter are ignored if the content of request-method is not PUT or POST.

The id of a constant must contain characters that are allowed in a URL path, which are [A-Z], [a-z], [0-9], hyphen (-), and underscore (_). The text of the value element is used as the value of the constant. Any XML or JSON markup that exists inside the value element is not present at run time. Literal XML values can be produced by either wrapping the contents of the element in a CDATA section, or escaping any angle brackets. Mapping Service Description parameters to Service Transport parameters, and vice versa, is defined using mapping elements. A root mapping element must be placed as a child of serviceDescription. This root mapping contains other mapping elements that describe how data is to be mapped. The source and target of a mapping are declared using attributes on the mapping element. These attributes are: source, sourceType, sourceRef, target, targetType, and targetRef. Each mapping element can also have child mapping elements that allow repeating structures and large XML or JSON documents to be produced. Mapping Structure The input and output of both Service Descriptions and Service Transports is a simple map of key value pairs. A value can be either a string, or a list of maps of key value pairs. Leap does not support a map as a value. A value of a key in one map cannot be another map, it must be either a string or a list of maps. The mapping elements within a Service Description instruct Leap on how to produce one such structure from another, potentially extracting values from strings treated as XML or JSON. Mapping Definition Each mapping element within a Service Description describes how Leap must map data from a source to a destination. Each mapping is made up of a source, and a target. The value of the source and target attributes is a colon separated value containing the scheme of the value and its name. Valid values for the scheme depend on the binding in which the mapping is located, and whether the scheme refers to the source or target of the mapping. For inbound mapping, the source scheme must be parameter or constant, and the target must be transport. For outbound mapping, the source scheme must be transport or constant, and the target must be parameter. A summary of the valid schemes and their contexts are listed in Table 1. The name component of a scheme identifies the key to use when looking up a value or where to place the result. Table 1. Summary of valid schemes and their contexts Scheme Inbound Inbound Outbound Outbound Type Source Target Source Target constant Yes No Yes No parameter Yes No No Yes transport No Yes Yes No Both the source and target have a type which instructs Leap how to work with the value. Both ends of a mapping can contain a reference, which allows a subset of the source to be placed at a specific location within the target. Valid values for type are string, xml, jsonand list, with string being the default. If the type is xml or json, the reference represents an XPath expression that determines which nodes are affected by the mapping. A source reference is used to extract a subset of the value identified by the source scheme. A target reference is used to construct the path where the value extracted from the source is placed. If there are no nodes that match a target reference, the node and its missing parent nodes are created. For this reason, only simple XPath predicates, those that use only the and operator, are permitted. In all other cases, the value of the reference is not used and is omitted. Each mapping element can also contain sub-mappings, which allow repeating structures to be iterated over and built. At run time, Leap server processes the mapping elements in top-down order. Nested mappings evaluate their source and target in the context of their parent source or target mapping. Run time Mapping At runtime, Leap server performs the following operations for each mapping element. Each mapping element is evaluated in the order in which it occurs within the root mapping element. Look up the source. Convert the source value if required (parse as XML or JSON). Resolve the source reference. Look up the target, if present. Convert the target value if required (parent as XML or JSON). Resolve the target reference. Map the source value to the target value. Evaluate child mapping elements. To look up the source, the Leap server first needs to determine the scheme. If the scheme is constant, the identified constant is looked up and returned. If there is no constant with the given name, an empty string is used. If the scheme is parameter or transport, then the current context is searched for the named item. For top-level mapping elements, this is the root of the parameter structure. For child mapping elements, this is the result of the lookup, conversion, and resolve operation on its parent. If the named value cannot be found in the current context, the parent context is checked until there are no more parent contexts. If the value does not exist in any context, an empty string is used. The value returned by the lookup operation is then converted into the type specified for the source or target. If the conversion produced an XML or JSON value, the reference is resolved, which returns a subset of the original value. The same lookup, conversion, and resolve operations are then performed on the target of the mapping. Once both the source and target are resolved, the mapping operation begins. Generally, the cardinality of the target matches the source. For example, if a list is the source, then the target must be a list. Similarly, if a single value is the source, then the target must be a single value. When the source is a single value, that value is assigned directly to the target value. When the source is a list, a new list is created to contain the results. For each item in the source list, the child mappings of the current mapping element are evaluated. The results of these mappings are added to the list being constructed. When all the source items are evaluated, the list is assigned to the target value.

Parent topic: Service Description","title":"Run time Mapping"},{"location":"ref_service_service_description.html","text":"Service Description A Service Description provides a specific interface to a Service Transport. The Service Description describes the inputs and outputs when you configure services within the HCL Leap mapping user interface. Elements of a Service Description A Service Description is represented as an XML document that follows an XML schema. This single XML document contains all the information for a single Service Description: name, description, input and output parameters, and input and output mapping. For a full listing of the XML schema, refer to Appendix A - Service Description schema . The top-level element in a Service Description is the serviceDescription element. This element, and all of its childs, must be in the XML namespace with a URI of http://www.ibm.com/xmlns/prod/forms/services/serviceDescription/1.0. ID Each Service Description must contain a unique id that identifies it to the Leap server. The id can contain any characters that are valid as a component of a URL path. These characters include: Alphabetical letters \u2013 [A-Z], and [a-z] Numerals \u2013 [0-9] Hyphens \u2013 [-] Underscore \u2013 [_] Because a Service Description ID is a surrogate for the Service Description itself, this ID does not must be descriptive. Any UUID is a valid choice for a Service Description ID because it guarantees uniqueness and contains only characters that are valid in a URL path component. Transport ID A Service Description must reference a Service Transport to perform its underlying operation. Each Service Transport has its own unique transportId that uniquely identifies it to the Leap server. The ID for a Service Transport must be made available by its developer. Name and Description To help users build Leap applications with services, each Service Description contains both a name, and a description. The name and description elements allow you to localize a Leap Service Description in multiple languages using duplicate elements, each with a different xml:lang attribute and contents.See Localizing Service Descriptions for information about how to provide names and descriptions in multiple languages. Default Locale If the Service Description is not localized in the language of a particular user, the defaultLocale contains the locale in which the name and description must be presented. For example, if a user asks for the Service Description in French, but the Service Description has only English and Spanish strings, the English is returned if en is set as the defaultLocale. Credentials The credentials contains the configuration for a Credentials Provider. The ID of the credentials provider is specified in the providerId attribute. The credentials element can contain zero or more property elements to configure the properties of the specified Credentials Provider. Each property element must contain a name attribute whose value is the name of the property being configured, and a value attribute that contains the value of the property. Not all Credentials Providers are applicable to all Service Transports. Therefore, the documentation for each Service Transport must be consulted before you configure the credentials element. If the configured Service Transport does not understand the provider that is specified by providerId , the Service Description is not available. Bindings Every Service Description must specify its input and output structures. These structures outline the ID, name, description, and type of each parameter and any subparameters . In addition to the parameter structure, bindings might also contain a section that declares how data going into the Service Transport is mapped from the input structure and how data coming from the Service Transport is mapped to the output structure. There are two top-level elements for bindings: inbound, and outbound. Inbound defines the binding for data coming into the Service Description from the Builder Application. Outbound defines the data going to the Leap application from the Service Description. Only one of each of these elements can be present within a single Service Description, and each must be placed as a child of the serviceDescription element. Directly underneath inbound and outbound are two elements that define the main components of a binding: parameters and serviceMapping . The parameters element contains all the information that is related to the parameters. The contents of the serviceMapping element instructs Leap how to map data coming from the parameters into data for the transport and vice versa. Parameters The parameters element contains zero or more parameter elements. Each parameter element defines a single parameter coming into or being returned from the Service Description. Each parameter element must have an id , type , name , and description . The id element uniquely identifies the parameter within the binding. The type element specifies the type of data that is expected to be contained within the parameter. The following data types are supported: STRING, BOOLEAN, DECIMAL, FLOAT, DOUBLE, INTEGER, DATETIME, TIME, DATE, and LIST . As with the name and description child elements of the serviceDescription element, these childs of parameter specify the name and description of the parameter that is used in Leap. These elements can also be localized using the xml:lang attribute. Optionally, the mandatory element can be included for inbound bindings to specify whether the parameter must be bound before starting the Service Description. Valid values for this element are true and false, with the latter being the default. Each parameter element can have a child element that is called parameters which is a container for child parameters. The contents of the parameters element is one or more parameter elements. If a parameter contains subparameters , its type is set to LIST. At run time, the parameter contains a list of structures with each of the subparameters . Service Mapping The serviceMapping element contains all the information that is needed for the Leap server to map data between the Service Description parameters, and the Service Transport. For more information, see Mapping Data for a Service Description . XML Namespaces XML namespace declarations must be defined on the serviceMapping element or higher. Sample Service Descriptions Each example in this section includes a list of the Service Descriptions and a discussion of how each Service Description operates. The Service Descriptions in this section rely solely on the Service Transports that are shipped with the Leap server. Where applicable, sample and setup instructions are included. Example 1: Simple Mapping The following Service Description uses the HTTP Service Transport to make a request to a web server and return the content type of the response. In this example, the URL to which the request is made comes as an inbound parameter from the Builder application. 1: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> 2: <serviceDescription> 3: <id> get-content-type </id> 4: <defaultLocale> en-us </defaultLocale> 5: <transportId> HTTPServiceTransport </transportId> 6: <name xml:lang= \"en-us\" > Get Content Type </name> 7: <description xml:lang= \"en-us\" > 8: Retrieves the content type of the response from an HTTP server for the configured URL. 9: </description> 10: <inbound> 11: <parameters> 12: <parameter> 13: <id> request-url </id> 14: <type> STRING </type> 15: <name xml:lang= \"en-us\" > URL </name> 16: <description xml:lang= \"en-us\" > URL to request. </description> 17: <mandatory> true </mandatory> 18: </parameter> 19: </parameters> 20: </inbound> 21: <outbound> 22: <parameters> 23: <parameter> 24: <id> response-header-content-type </id> 25: <type> STRING </type> 26: <name xml:lang= \"en-us\" > Content Type </name> 27: <description xml:lang= \"en-us\" > Content Type of the response. </description> 28: </parameter> 29: </parameters> 30: </outbound> 31: </serviceDescription> All Service Descriptions begin with a serviceDescription element, and in this example, it is defined in line 2. The serviceDescription element contains all the information that is needed for the Leap server to work with the Service Description. The unique ID of this Service Description is get-content-type as defined in line 3. The unique ID is not exposed to a user, but it must be unique. Line 5 declares the ID of the Service Transport to use, which is HTTPServiceTransport , and this is the unique ID of the HTTP Service Transport. Lines 7 and 8 define the name and description of the Service Description, which are presented to the user when designing applications. Lines 10-20 define the inbound bindings, and lines 21-30 define the outbound bindings. As mentioned previously, the inbound bindings refer to the parameters that are flowing from the application to the Service Transport. The outbound bindings refer to the parameters that are flowing in the opposite direction. Lines 11-19 contain all the inbound parameters, of which there is only one. The parameter that is defined in lines 12-18 represents the URL to which a request is made. According to the HTTP Service Transport documentation, the parameter that contains the URL to which the request is made must be called request-url . Line 13 defines the id of the parameter so that it matches the expectations of the HTTP Service Transport. The name and description are defined in lines 15 and 16, and line 17 specifies that this parameter must be supplied in order for this Service Description to operate. Lines 21-30 define the outbound parameters for the Service Description. In this case, there is only one output parameter: the content type of the response. The HTTP Service Transport dynamically creates new parameters that are based on the information that is returned in the HTTP response. In particular, response headers are converted to lowercase and are prefixed with response-header- . Since this Service Description is interested in the Content-Type header, the outbound parameter response-header-content-type is created in lines 23-28 to contain this data. Example 2: Augmenting Parameters with Constants The following Service Description returns the same information as Example 1. However, in this case, we do not want the Leap application to supply the URL. Instead, the URL is declared using a constant, and mapped into the inbound parameters for the Service Transport. 1: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> 2: <serviceDescription> 3: <id> get-content-type-with-constant </id> 4: <defaultLocale> en-us </defaultLocale> 5: <transportId> HTTPServiceTransport </transportId> 6: <name xml:lang= \"en-us\" > Get Content Type with Constant </name> 7: <description xml:lang= \"en-us\" > 8: Retreives the content type of the response from an HTTP server. 9: </description> 10: <inbound> 11: <serviceMapping> 12: <constants> 13: <constant> 14: <id> url-to-request </id> 15: <value> http://www.ibm.com </value> 16: </constant> 17: </constants> 18: <mapping> 19: <mapping source= \"constant:url-to-request\" sourceType= \"string\" target= \"transport:request-url\" targetType= \"string\" /> 20: </mapping> 21: </serviceMapping> 22: </inbound> 23: <outbound> 24: <parameters> 25: <parameter> 26: <id> response-header-content-type </id> 27: <type> STRING </type> 28: <name xml:lang= \"en-us\" > Content Type </name> 29: <description xml:lang= \"en-us\" > Content Type of the response. </description> 30: </parameter> 31: </parameters> 32: </outbound> 33: </serviceDescription> Like Example 1, the Service Description makes a request to an HTTP server and returns the content type of the response. However, this Service Description differs from the Example 1 because there are no input parameters to this service. The request-url HTTP Service Transport parameter is mapped into the transport via a constant. Lines 12-17 define the constants section. There is a single constant that is defined in lines 13-16. This constant has an id of url-to-request specified in line 14, and a value of http://www.ibm.com, specified in line 15. The id of the constant is used when creating the parameter structure that is passed to the Service Transport. This constant is referenced in line 19 within the mapping section. Lines 18-20 contain the mapping information. Since there is only one parameter to be sent, there is only one mapping, which is defined in line 19. This mapping specifies that the value of the Service Transport parameter named request-url is specified by the value of the constant named url-to-request . Example 3: Lists of Data The following Service Description demonstrates the use of nested parameters. This example is the same as the Service Description used for the Countries by Region service that is shipped with Leap. This example describes how to specify a region and return a list of the names of countries within that region. 1: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> 2: <serviceDescription> 3: <id> countries-by-region </id> 4: <defaultLocale> en-us </defaultLocale> 5: <transportId> 4647b8cf-093f-11e0-89dd-001e4cf83606 </transportId> 6: <name xml:lang= \"en-us\" > 7: Countries by Region using Service Description 8: </name> 9: <description xml:lang= \"en-us\" > 10: Given a region, return a list of country information in that region. 11: </description> 12: <inbound> 13: <parameters> 14: <parameter> 15: <id> region </id> 16: <type> STRING </type> 17: <name xml:lang= \"en-us\" > Region </name> 18: <description xml:lang= \"en-us\" > 19: One of \"Africa\", \"America, North\", \"America, South\", \"Asia\", \"Europe\", or \"Oceania\" 20: </description> 21: <mandatory> true </mandatory> 22: </parameter> 23: </parameters> 24: </inbound> 25: <outbound> 26: <parameters> 27: <parameter> 28: <id> countries </id> 29: <type> LIST </type> 30: <name xml:lang= \"en-us\" > Countries\" </name> 31: <description xml:lang= \"en-us\" > List of country information </description> 32: <parameters> 33: <parameter> 34: <id> name </id> 35: <type> STRING </type> 36: <name xml:lang= \"en-us\" > Name </name> 37: <description xml:lang= \"en-us\" > Name of Country </description> 38: </parameter> 39: </parameters> 40: </parameter> 41: </parameters> 42: </outbound> 43: </serviceDescription> As with the other Service Description examples, this Service Description has its own unique ID, defined in line 3, a name, which is defined in lines 6-8, and a description, which is defined in lines 9-11. This Service Description uses the sample Countries by Region Service Transport, which is shipped with the Leap , and is identified by its id in line 5. Because this Service Description has a single inbound parameter, the parameters element, in lines 13-23, of the inbound bindings in lines 12-24. parameters contains only a single parameter, which is defined in lines 14-22. The id of this parameter is region, which is what is expected by the Countries by Region Service Transport. Since there can be multiple countries within a region, the outbound bindings, which are defined in lines 25-42, must contain a list parameter to contain all the information for each country. The outbound structure for this Service Description consists of a parameter that is called countries that contains a list of maps. Each of the maps that are contained within the countries list consists of a single name key that contains the name of a country. This structure is defined within the parameters element, which is defined in lines 26-41, of the outbound bindings section. The top-level parameter, countries, is defined between lines 27 and 40. Since the countries parameter contains other parameters, its type is set as LIST in line 29. All the parameters of the list entries are defined within the parameters element inside the countries parameter that is defined in lines 32-39. The single name subparameter is defined in lines 33-38. Since the inbound and outbound bindings directly match what is returned by the Countries by Region Service Transport, there is no need for any mapping information. This service can be set up such that the name subparameter is mapped to list-like items such as drop-down options or an item in a table. Example 4: Mapping XML into Parameters The following Service Description extracts data from an XML document that is returned from an HTTP request using the HTTP Service Transport. 1: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> 2: <serviceDescription> 3: <id> address-lookup </id> 4: <defaultLocale> en-us </defaultLocale> 5: <transportId> HTTPServiceTransport </transportId> 6: <name xml:lang= \"en-us\" > Address Lookup </name> 7: <description xml:lang= \"en-us\" > Returns information related to a postal code or address. </description> 8: <inbound> 9: <parameters> 10: <parameter> 11: <id> address </id> 12: <type> STRING </type> 13: <name xml:lang= \"en-us\" > Address or Postal Code </name> 14: <description xml:lang= \"en-us\" ></description> 15: <mandatory> true </mandatory> 16: </parameter> 17: </parameters> 18: <serviceMapping> 19: <constants> 20: <constant> 21: <id> request-url </id> 22: <value> http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/xml </value> 23: </constant> 24: <constant> 25: <id> false-constant </id> 26: <value> false </value> 27: </constant> 28: <constant> 29: <id> request-method </id> 30: <value> GET </value> 31: </constant> 32: </constants> 33: <mapping> 34: <mapping target= \"transport:request-url\" source= \"constant:request-url\" /> 35: <mapping target= \"transport:request-method\" source= \"constant:request-method\" /> 36: <mapping target= \"transport:request-query-address\" source= \"parameter:address\" /> 37: <mapping target= \"transport:request-query-sensor\" source= \"constant:false-constant\" /> 38: </mapping> 39: </serviceMapping> 40: </inbound> 41: <outbound> 42: <parameters> 43: <parameter> 44: <id> latitude </id> 45: <type> STRING </type> 46: <name xml:lang= \"en-us\" > Latitude </name> 47: <description xml:lang= \"en-us\" ></description> 48: </parameter> 49: <parameter> 50: <id> longitude </id> 51: <type> STRING </type> 52: <name xml:lang= \"en-us\" > Longitude </name> 53: <description xml:lang= \"en-us\" ></description> 54: </parameter> 55: <parameter> 56: <id> address-information </id> 57: <type> LIST </type> 58: <name xml:lang= \"en-us\" > Address Information </name> 59: <description xml:lang= \"en-us\" ></description> 60: <parameters> 61: <parameter> 62: <id> long-name </id> 63: <type> STRING </type> 64: <name xml:lang= \"en-us\" > Long Name </name> 65: <description xml:lang= \"en-us\" ></description> 66: </parameter> 67: <parameter> 68: <id> short-name </id> 69: <type> STRING </type> 70: <name xml:lang= \"en-us\" > Short Name </name> 71: <description xml:lang= \"en-us\" ></description> 72: </parameter> 73: <parameter> 74: <id> type-1 </id> 75: <type> STRING </type> 76: <name xml:lang= \"en-us\" > Type </name> 77: <description xml:lang= \"en-us\" ></description> 78: </parameter> 79: <parameter> 80: <id> type-2 </id> 81: <type> STRING </type> 82: <name xml:lang= \"en-us\" > Type(2) </name> 83: <description xml:lang= \"en-us\" ></description> 84: </parameter> 85: </parameters> 86: </parameter> 87: </parameters> 88: <serviceMapping> 89: <mapping> 90: <mapping source= \"transport:response-entity\" 91: sourceRef= \"GeocodeResponse/result[1]/geometry/location/lat\" 92: sourceType= \"xml\" 93: target= \"parameter:latitude\" /> 94: <mapping source= \"transport:response-entity\" 95: sourceRef= \"GeocodeResponse/result[1]/geometry/location/lng\" 96: sourceType= \"xml\" 97: target= \"parameter:longitude\" /> 98: <mapping source= \"transport:response-entity\" 99: sourceRef= \"GeocodeResponse/result[1]/address_component\" 100: sourceType= \"xml\" 101: target= \"parameter:address-information\" > 102: <mapping sourceRef= \"long_name\" target= \"parameter:long-name\" /> 103: <mapping sourceRef= \"short_name\" target= \"parameter:short-name\" /> 104: <mapping sourceRef= \"type[1]\" target= \"parameter:type-1\" /> 105: <mapping sourceRef= \"type[2]\" target= \"parameter:type-2\" /> 106: </mapping> 107: </mapping> 108: </serviceMapping> 109: </outbound> 110: </serviceDescription> This Service Description performs a reverse address lookup using a free Google web service. As with the other Service Description examples, the standard prologue of id, transportId , name, and description is specified in lines 3-7. This service has a single parameter, address, that can be assigned by an application, as specified in lines 10-16. Since this parameter is required to perform the address look-up, it is marked as mandatory in line 15. Since this Service Description uses the HTTP Service Transport, a request-url must be specified. The URL used in this request takes the form http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/xml?address=[address]&sensor=[true|false]. Because there are query parameters that must be sent, this Service Description uses the HTTP Service Transport support for query parameters by prefixing the name of the parameter with request-query-. However, because some of these query parameters are not exposed to the user, you must create a mapping section to map some constant values. The inbound binding constant section, in lines 19-32, defines the three constants that are used: request-url , lines 20-23, false-constant, lines 24-27, and request-method , lines 28-31. These constants contain the URL to which to request is made, a constant string value false for the sensor query parameter, and the request method. While some of these constants, including request-url and request-method, match the name of the parameter to which they are applied, there is no requirement that they match. Parameter names that match do not automatically get a constant value if it has the same name. All mapping must be explicitly defined. In lines 33-38, the mapping section of the inbound binding maps the constants and Service Description parameters to the Service Transport parameters. Each of the mapping elements is fairly self-explanatory: the request-url constant is mapped to the request-url transport parameter; the request-method constant is mapped to the request-method transport parameter; the address parameter is mapped to the request-query-address transport parameter; and the constant false-constant is mapped to the sensor transport parameter. The HTTP Service Transport then builds a URL out of the request-url , request-query-address , and request-query-sensor parameters, and makes a request to that URL using the HTTP method given in the request-method parameter. The response body that is returned by this request is placed in the response-entity transport parameter, which is then taken apart by the mapping section of the outbound bindings. This service expects the response-entity to be similar to the following: 1: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> 2: <GeocodeResponse> 3: <status> OK </status> 4: <result> 5: <type> street_address </type> 6: <formatted_address> 1 New Orchard Rd, Armonk, NY, USA </formatted_address> 7: <address_component> 8: <long_name> 1 </long_name> 9: <short_name> 1 </short_name> 10: <type> street_number </type> 11: </address_component> 12: <address_component> 13: <long_name> New Orchard Rd </long_name> 14: <short_name> New Orchard Rd </short_name> 15: <type> route </type> 16: </address_component> 17: <address_component> 18: <long_name> Armonk </long_name> 19: <short_name> Armonk </short_name> 20: <type> locality </type> 21: <type> political </type> 22: </address_component> 23: <address_component> 24: <long_name> Westchester </long_name> 25: <short_name> Westchester </short_name> 26: <type> administrative_area_level_2 </type> 27: <type> political </type> 28: </address_component> 29: <address_component> 30: <long_name> New York </long_name> 31: <short_name> NY </short_name> 32: <type> administrative_area_level_1 </type> 33: <type> political </type> 34: </address_component> 35: <address_component> 36: <long_name> United States </long_name> 37: <short_name> US </short_name> 38: <type> country </type> 39: <type> political </type> 40: </address_component> 41: <geometry> 42: <location> 43: <lat> 41.1083018 </lat> 44: <lng> -73.7204677 </lng> 45: </location> 46: <location_type> ROOFTOP </location_type> 47: <viewport> 48: <southwest> 49: <lat> 41.1051542 </lat> 50: <lng> -73.7236153 </lng> 51: </southwest> 52: <northeast> 53: <lat> 41.1114494 </lat> 54: <lng> -73.7173201 </lng> 55: </northeast> 56: </viewport> 57: </geometry> 58: </result> 59: </GeocodeResponse> There is much data in this response, but only some of it is needed for this Service Description. The latitude, longitude, and a list of the address information from the first result is required. To get only the required information, the Service Description outlines the parameters that it expects to return in the parameters section, in lines 42-87. The Service Description then uses the mapping section, in lines 88-108, to extract the required data from the response-entity transport parameter. Each of the parameters in the parameters section is self-explanatory. Latitude and longitude are top-level parameters because there is only one of each of them in a single result. However, there are several address_component elements, each of which are returned. Therefore, the address-information parameter is a list parameter that contains subparameters, one for each of the pieces of information in an address_component that the Service Description wants to make available. In lines 88-108, the service mapping section defines all the mapping that must be performed to extract the data from the XML response. Latitude, which is specified in lines 90-93, and longitude, which is specified in lines 94-97, each extract the data using a single XPath expression. The source type for each is set to XML. Mapping of a repeating structure is accomplished in a similar fashion. Lines 98-101 define the mapping for the address-information parameter. The XPath expression for address-information returns a nodeset as there are several nodes that match the expression GeocodeResponse/result/address_component. For each node that is returned, a new structure is created to contain the result of each of the submappings. Each of the submappings places its target into the newly created structure. Since the source of each of the submappings is one of the matched nodes, the mapping elements do not specify a source. It is assumed to be the inherited context. Similarly, the reference is evaluated within the context of the source, which is inherited. After each of the submappings is evaluated for a single source, the structure is added to a running list and the submappings are evaluated again for the next result in the source list. When all the sources are processed, the list that was collecting the results of the map is assigned to the address-information parameter. Localizing Service Descriptions The name and description elements allow you to localize an HCL Leap Service Description in multiple languages using duplicate elements, each with a different xml:lang attribute and contents. Mapping Data for a Service Description The serviceMapping element of the Service Description contains all the information needed for the HCL Leap server to map data from the Service Description inbound data to the Service Transport Deploying a Service Description This topic contains information about how to deploy an HCL Leap Service Description. Parent topic: Services","title":"Service Description"},{"location":"ref_service_service_description.html#service-description","text":"A Service Description provides a specific interface to a Service Transport. The Service Description describes the inputs and outputs when you configure services within the HCL Leap mapping user interface.","title":"Service Description"},{"location":"ref_service_service_description.html#elements-of-a-service-description","text":"A Service Description is represented as an XML document that follows an XML schema. This single XML document contains all the information for a single Service Description: name, description, input and output parameters, and input and output mapping. For a full listing of the XML schema, refer to Appendix A - Service Description schema . The top-level element in a Service Description is the serviceDescription element. This element, and all of its childs, must be in the XML namespace with a URI of http://www.ibm.com/xmlns/prod/forms/services/serviceDescription/1.0. ID Each Service Description must contain a unique id that identifies it to the Leap server. The id can contain any characters that are valid as a component of a URL path. These characters include: Alphabetical letters \u2013 [A-Z], and [a-z] Numerals \u2013 [0-9] Hyphens \u2013 [-] Underscore \u2013 [_] Because a Service Description ID is a surrogate for the Service Description itself, this ID does not must be descriptive. Any UUID is a valid choice for a Service Description ID because it guarantees uniqueness and contains only characters that are valid in a URL path component. Transport ID A Service Description must reference a Service Transport to perform its underlying operation. Each Service Transport has its own unique transportId that uniquely identifies it to the Leap server. The ID for a Service Transport must be made available by its developer. Name and Description To help users build Leap applications with services, each Service Description contains both a name, and a description. The name and description elements allow you to localize a Leap Service Description in multiple languages using duplicate elements, each with a different xml:lang attribute and contents.See Localizing Service Descriptions for information about how to provide names and descriptions in multiple languages. Default Locale If the Service Description is not localized in the language of a particular user, the defaultLocale contains the locale in which the name and description must be presented. For example, if a user asks for the Service Description in French, but the Service Description has only English and Spanish strings, the English is returned if en is set as the defaultLocale. Credentials The credentials contains the configuration for a Credentials Provider. The ID of the credentials provider is specified in the providerId attribute. The credentials element can contain zero or more property elements to configure the properties of the specified Credentials Provider. Each property element must contain a name attribute whose value is the name of the property being configured, and a value attribute that contains the value of the property. Not all Credentials Providers are applicable to all Service Transports. Therefore, the documentation for each Service Transport must be consulted before you configure the credentials element. If the configured Service Transport does not understand the provider that is specified by providerId , the Service Description is not available. Bindings Every Service Description must specify its input and output structures. These structures outline the ID, name, description, and type of each parameter and any subparameters . In addition to the parameter structure, bindings might also contain a section that declares how data going into the Service Transport is mapped from the input structure and how data coming from the Service Transport is mapped to the output structure. There are two top-level elements for bindings: inbound, and outbound. Inbound defines the binding for data coming into the Service Description from the Builder Application. Outbound defines the data going to the Leap application from the Service Description. Only one of each of these elements can be present within a single Service Description, and each must be placed as a child of the serviceDescription element. Directly underneath inbound and outbound are two elements that define the main components of a binding: parameters and serviceMapping . The parameters element contains all the information that is related to the parameters. The contents of the serviceMapping element instructs Leap how to map data coming from the parameters into data for the transport and vice versa. Parameters The parameters element contains zero or more parameter elements. Each parameter element defines a single parameter coming into or being returned from the Service Description. Each parameter element must have an id , type , name , and description . The id element uniquely identifies the parameter within the binding. The type element specifies the type of data that is expected to be contained within the parameter. The following data types are supported: STRING, BOOLEAN, DECIMAL, FLOAT, DOUBLE, INTEGER, DATETIME, TIME, DATE, and LIST . As with the name and description child elements of the serviceDescription element, these childs of parameter specify the name and description of the parameter that is used in Leap. These elements can also be localized using the xml:lang attribute. Optionally, the mandatory element can be included for inbound bindings to specify whether the parameter must be bound before starting the Service Description. Valid values for this element are true and false, with the latter being the default. Each parameter element can have a child element that is called parameters which is a container for child parameters. The contents of the parameters element is one or more parameter elements. If a parameter contains subparameters , its type is set to LIST. At run time, the parameter contains a list of structures with each of the subparameters . Service Mapping The serviceMapping element contains all the information that is needed for the Leap server to map data between the Service Description parameters, and the Service Transport.

The Service Descriptions in this section rely solely on the Service Transports that are shipped with the Leap server. Where applicable, sample and setup instructions are included. Example 1: Simple Mapping The following Service Description uses the HTTP Service Transport to make a request to a web server and return the content type of the response. In this example, the URL to which the request is made comes as an inbound parameter from the Builder application. 1: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> 2: <serviceDescription> 3: <id> get-content-type </id> 4: <defaultLocale> en-us </defaultLocale> 5: <transportId> HTTPServiceTransport </transportId> 6: <name xml:lang= \"en-us\" > Get Content Type </name> 7: <description xml:lang= \"en-us\" > 8: Retrieves the content type of the response from an HTTP server for the configured URL. 9: </description> 10: <inbound> 11: <parameters> 12: <parameter> 13: <id> request-url </id> 14: <type> STRING </type> 15: <name xml:lang= \"en-us\" > URL </name> 16: <description xml:lang= \"en-us\" > URL to request. </description> 17: <mandatory> true </mandatory> 18: </parameter> 19: </parameters> 20: </inbound> 21: <outbound> 22: <parameters> 23: <parameter> 24: <id> response-header-content-type </id> 25: <type> STRING </type> 26: <name xml:lang= \"en-us\" > Content Type </name> 27: <description xml:lang= \"en-us\" > Content Type of the response. </description> 28: </parameter> 29: </parameters> 30: </outbound> 31: </serviceDescription> All Service Descriptions begin with a serviceDescription element, and in this example, it is defined in line 2. The serviceDescription element contains all the information that is needed for the Leap server to work with the Service Description. The unique ID of this Service Description is get-content-type as defined in line 3. The unique ID is not exposed to a user, but it must be unique. Line 5 declares the ID of the Service Transport to use, which is HTTPServiceTransport , and this is the unique ID of the HTTP Service Transport. Lines 7 and 8 define the name and description of the Service Description, which are presented to the user when designing applications. Lines 10-20 define the inbound bindings, and lines 21-30 define the outbound bindings. As mentioned previously, the inbound bindings refer to the parameters that are flowing from the application to the Service Transport. The outbound bindings refer to the parameters that are flowing in the opposite direction. Lines 11-19 contain all the inbound parameters, of which there is only one. The parameter that is defined in lines 12-18 represents the URL to which a request is made. According to the HTTP Service Transport documentation, the parameter that contains the URL to which the request is made must be called request-url . Line 13 defines the id of the parameter so that it matches the expectations of the HTTP Service Transport. The name and description are defined in lines 15 and 16, and line 17 specifies that this parameter must be supplied in order for this Service Description to operate. Lines 21-30 define the outbound parameters for the Service Description. In this case, there is only one output parameter: the content type of the response. The HTTP Service Transport dynamically creates new parameters that are based on the information that is returned in the HTTP response. In particular, response headers are converted to lowercase and are prefixed with response-header- . Since this Service Description is interested in the Content-Type header, the outbound parameter response-header-content-type is created in lines 23-28 to contain this data. Example 2: Augmenting Parameters with Constants The following Service Description returns the same information as Example 1. However, in this case, we do not want the Leap application to supply the URL. Instead, the URL is declared using a constant, and mapped into the inbound parameters for the Service Transport. 1: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> 2: <serviceDescription> 3: <id> get-content-type-with-constant </id> 4: <defaultLocale> en-us </defaultLocale> 5: <transportId> HTTPServiceTransport </transportId> 6: <name xml:lang= \"en-us\" > Get Content Type with Constant </name> 7: <description xml:lang= \"en-us\" > 8: Retreives the content type of the response from an HTTP server. 9: </description> 10: <inbound> 11: <serviceMapping> 12: <constants> 13: <constant> 14: <id> url-to-request </id> 15: <value> http://www.ibm.com </value> 16: </constant> 17: </constants> 18: <mapping> 19: <mapping source= \"constant:url-to-request\" sourceType= \"string\" target= \"transport:request-url\" targetType= \"string\" /> 20: </mapping> 21: </serviceMapping> 22: </inbound> 23: <outbound> 24: <parameters> 25: <parameter> 26: <id> response-header-content-type </id> 27: <type> STRING </type> 28: <name xml:lang= \"en-us\" > Content Type </name> 29: <description xml:lang= \"en-us\" > Content Type of the response. </description> 30: </parameter> 31: </parameters> 32: </outbound> 33: </serviceDescription> Like Example 1, the Service Description makes a request to an HTTP server and returns the content type of the response. However, this Service Description differs from the Example 1 because there are no input parameters to this service. The request-url HTTP Service Transport parameter is mapped into the transport via a constant. Lines 12-17 define the constants section. There is a single constant that is defined in lines 13-16. This constant has an id of url-to-request specified in line 14, and a value of http://www.ibm.com, specified in line 15. The id of the constant is used when creating the parameter structure that is passed to the Service Transport. This constant is referenced in line 19 within the mapping section. Lines 18-20 contain the mapping information. Since there is only one parameter to be sent, there is only one mapping, which is defined in line 19. This mapping specifies that the value of the Service Transport parameter named request-url is specified by the value of the constant named url-to-request . Example 3: Lists of Data The following Service Description demonstrates the use of nested parameters. This example is the same as the Service Description used for the Countries by Region service that is shipped with Leap. This example describes how to specify a region and return a list of the names of countries within that region. 1: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> 2: <serviceDescription> 3: <id> countries-by-region </id> 4: <defaultLocale> en-us </defaultLocale> 5: <transportId> 4647b8cf-093f-11e0-89dd-001e4cf83606 </transportId> 6: <name xml:lang= \"en-us\" > 7: Countries by Region using Service Description 8: </name> 9: <description xml:lang= \"en-us\" > 10: Given a region, return a list of country information in that region. 11: </description> 12: <inbound> 13: <parameters> 14: <parameter> 15: <id> region </id> 16: <type> STRING </type> 17: <name xml:lang= \"en-us\" > Region </name> 18: <description xml:lang= \"en-us\" > 19: One of \"Africa\", \"America, North\", \"America, South\", \"Asia\", \"Europe\", or \"Oceania\" 20: </description> 21: <mandatory> true </mandatory> 22: </parameter> 23: </parameters> 24: </inbound> 25: <outbound> 26: <parameters> 27: <parameter> 28: <id> countries </id> 29: <type> LIST </type> 30: <name xml:lang= \"en-us\" > Countries\" </name> 31: <description xml:lang= \"en-us\" > List of country information </description> 32: <parameters> 33: <parameter> 34: <id> name </id> 35: <type> STRING </type> 36: <name xml:lang= \"en-us\" > Name </name> 37: <description xml:lang= \"en-us\" > Name of Country </description> 38: </parameter> 39: </parameters> 40: </parameter> 41: </parameters> 42: </outbound> 43: </serviceDescription> As with the other Service Description examples, this Service Description has its own unique ID, defined in line 3, a name, which is defined in lines 6-8, and a description, which is defined in lines 9-11. This Service Description uses the sample Countries by Region Service Transport, which is shipped with the Leap , and is identified by its id in line 5. Because this Service Description has a single inbound parameter, the parameters element, in lines 13-23, of the inbound bindings in lines 12-24. parameters contains only a single parameter, which is defined in lines 14-22. The id of this parameter is region, which is what is expected by the Countries by Region Service Transport. Since there can be multiple countries within a region, the outbound bindings, which are defined in lines 25-42, must contain a list parameter to contain all the information for each country. The outbound structure for this Service Description consists of a parameter that is called countries that contains a list of maps. Each of the maps that are contained within the countries list consists of a single name key that contains the name of a country. This structure is defined within the parameters element, which is defined in lines 26-41, of the outbound bindings section. The top-level parameter, countries, is defined between lines 27 and 40. Since the countries parameter contains other parameters, its type is set as LIST in line 29. All the parameters of the list entries are defined within the parameters element inside the countries parameter that is defined in lines 32-39. The single name subparameter is defined in lines 33-38. Since the inbound and outbound bindings directly match what is returned by the Countries by Region Service Transport, there is no need for any mapping information. This service can be set up such that the name subparameter is mapped to list-like items such as drop-down options or an item in a table. Example 4: Mapping XML into Parameters The following Service Description extracts data from an XML document that is returned from an HTTP request using the HTTP Service Transport. 1: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> 2: <serviceDescription> 3: <id> address-lookup </id> 4: <defaultLocale> en-us </defaultLocale> 5: <transportId> HTTPServiceTransport </transportId> 6: <name xml:lang= \"en-us\" > Address Lookup </name> 7: <description xml:lang= \"en-us\" > Returns information related to a postal code or address. </description> 8: <inbound> 9: <parameters> 10: <parameter> 11: <id> address </id> 12: <type> STRING </type> 13: <name xml:lang= \"en-us\" > Address or Postal Code </name> 14: <description xml:lang= \"en-us\" ></description> 15: <mandatory> true </mandatory> 16: </parameter> 17: </parameters> 18: <serviceMapping> 19: <constants> 20: <constant> 21: <id> request-url </id> 22: <value> http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/xml </value> 23: </constant> 24: <constant> 25: <id> false-constant </id> 26: <value> false </value> 27: </constant> 28: <constant> 29: <id> request-method </id> 30: <value> GET </value> 31: </constant> 32: </constants> 33: <mapping> 34: <mapping target= \"transport:request-url\" source= \"constant:request-url\" /> 35: <mapping target= \"transport:request-method\" source= \"constant:request-method\" /> 36: <mapping target= \"transport:request-query-address\" source= \"parameter:address\" /> 37: <mapping target= \"transport:request-query-sensor\" source= \"constant:false-constant\" /> 38: </mapping> 39: </serviceMapping> 40: </inbound> 41: <outbound> 42: <parameters> 43: <parameter> 44: <id> latitude </id> 45: <type> STRING </type> 46: <name xml:lang= \"en-us\" > Latitude </name> 47: <description xml:lang= \"en-us\" ></description> 48: </parameter> 49: <parameter> 50: <id> longitude </id> 51: <type> STRING </type> 52: <name xml:lang= \"en-us\" > Longitude </name> 53: <description xml:lang= \"en-us\" ></description> 54: </parameter> 55: <parameter> 56: <id> address-information </id> 57: <type> LIST </type> 58: <name xml:lang= \"en-us\" > Address Information </name> 59: <description xml:lang= \"en-us\" ></description> 60: <parameters> 61: <parameter> 62: <id> long-name </id> 63: <type> STRING </type> 64: <name xml:lang= \"en-us\" > Long Name </name> 65: <description xml:lang= \"en-us\" ></description> 66: </parameter> 67: <parameter> 68: <id> short-name </id> 69: <type> STRING </type> 70: <name xml:lang= \"en-us\" > Short Name </name> 71: <description xml:lang= \"en-us\" ></description> 72: </parameter> 73: <parameter> 74: <id> type-1 </id> 75: <type> STRING </type> 76: <name xml:lang= \"en-us\" > Type </name> 77: <description xml:lang= \"en-us\" ></description> 78: </parameter> 79: <parameter> 80: <id> type-2 </id> 81: <type> STRING </type> 82: <name xml:lang= \"en-us\" > Type(2) </name> 83: <description xml:lang= \"en-us\" ></description> 84: </parameter> 85: </parameters> 86: </parameter> 87: </parameters> 88: <serviceMapping> 89: <mapping> 90: <mapping source= \"transport:response-entity\" 91: sourceRef= \"GeocodeResponse/result[1]/geometry/location/lat\" 92: sourceType= \"xml\" 93: target= \"parameter:latitude\" /> 94: <mapping source= \"transport:response-entity\" 95: sourceRef= \"GeocodeResponse/result[1]/geometry/location/lng\" 96: sourceType= \"xml\" 97: target= \"parameter:longitude\" /> 98: <mapping source= \"transport:response-entity\" 99: sourceRef= \"GeocodeResponse/result[1]/address_component\" 100: sourceType= \"xml\" 101: target= \"parameter:address-information\" > 102: <mapping sourceRef= \"long_name\" target= \"parameter:long-name\" /> 103: <mapping sourceRef= \"short_name\" target= \"parameter:short-name\" /> 104: <mapping sourceRef= \"type[1]\" target= \"parameter:type-1\" /> 105: <mapping sourceRef= \"type[2]\" target= \"parameter:type-2\" /> 106: </mapping> 107: </mapping> 108: </serviceMapping> 109: </outbound> 110: </serviceDescription> This Service Description performs a reverse address lookup using a free Google web service. As with the other Service Description examples, the standard prologue of id, transportId , name, and description is specified in lines 3-7. This service has a single parameter, address, that can be assigned by an application, as specified in lines 10-16. Since this parameter is required to perform the address look-up, it is marked as mandatory in line 15. Since this Service Description uses the HTTP Service Transport, a request-url must be specified. The URL used in this request takes the form http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/xml?address=[address]&sensor=[true|false]. Because there are query parameters that must be sent, this Service Description uses the HTTP Service Transport support for query parameters by prefixing the name of the parameter with request-query-. However, because some of these query parameters are not exposed to the user, you must create a mapping section to map some constant values. The inbound binding constant section, in lines 19-32, defines the three constants that are used: request-url , lines 20-23, false-constant, lines 24-27, and request-method , lines 28-31. These constants contain the URL to which to request is made, a constant string value false for the sensor query parameter, and the request method. While some of these constants, including request-url and request-method, match the name of the parameter to which they are applied, there is no requirement that they match. Parameter names that match do not automatically get a constant value if it has the same name. All mapping must be explicitly defined. In lines 33-38, the mapping section of the inbound binding maps the constants and Service Description parameters to the Service Transport parameters. Each of the mapping elements is fairly self-explanatory: the request-url constant is mapped to the request-url transport parameter; the request-method constant is mapped to the request-method transport parameter; the address parameter is mapped to the request-query-address transport parameter; and the constant false-constant is mapped to the sensor transport parameter. The HTTP Service Transport then builds a URL out of the request-url , request-query-address , and request-query-sensor parameters, and makes a request to that URL using the HTTP method given in the request-method parameter. The response body that is returned by this request is placed in the response-entity transport parameter, which is then taken apart by the mapping section of the outbound bindings. This service expects the response-entity to be similar to the following: 1: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> 2: <GeocodeResponse> 3: <status> OK </status> 4: <result> 5: <type> street_address </type> 6: <formatted_address> 1 New Orchard Rd, Armonk, NY, USA </formatted_address> 7: <address_component> 8: <long_name> 1 </long_name> 9: <short_name> 1 </short_name> 10: <type> street_number </type> 11: </address_component> 12: <address_component> 13: <long_name> New Orchard Rd </long_name> 14: <short_name> New Orchard Rd </short_name> 15: <type> route </type> 16: </address_component> 17: <address_component> 18: <long_name> Armonk </long_name> 19: <short_name> Armonk </short_name> 20: <type> locality </type> 21: <type> political </type> 22: </address_component> 23: <address_component> 24: <long_name> Westchester </long_name> 25: <short_name> Westchester </short_name> 26: <type> administrative_area_level_2 </type> 27: <type> political </type> 28: </address_component> 29: <address_component> 30: <long_name> New York </long_name> 31: <short_name> NY </short_name> 32: <type> administrative_area_level_1 </type> 33: <type> political </type> 34: </address_component> 35: <address_component> 36: <long_name> United States </long_name> 37: <short_name> US </short_name> 38: <type> country </type> 39: <type> political </type> 40: </address_component> 41: <geometry> 42: <location> 43: <lat> 41.1083018 </lat> 44: <lng> -73.7204677 </lng> 45: </location> 46: <location_type> ROOFTOP </location_type> 47: <viewport> 48: <southwest> 49: <lat> 41.1051542 </lat> 50: <lng> -73.7236153 </lng> 51: </southwest> 52: <northeast> 53: <lat> 41.1114494 </lat> 54: <lng> -73.7173201 </lng> 55: </northeast> 56: </viewport> 57: </geometry> 58: </result> 59: </GeocodeResponse> There is much data in this response, but only some of it is needed for this Service Description. The latitude, longitude, and a list of the address information from the first result is required. To get only the required information, the Service Description outlines the parameters that it expects to return in the parameters section, in lines 42-87. The Service Description then uses the mapping section, in lines 88-108, to extract the required data from the response-entity transport parameter. Each of the parameters in the parameters section is self-explanatory. Latitude and longitude are top-level parameters because there is only one of each of them in a single result. However, there are several address_component elements, each of which are returned. Therefore, the address-information parameter is a list parameter that contains subparameters, one for each of the pieces of information in an address_component that the Service Description wants to make available. In lines 88-108, the service mapping section defines all the mapping that must be performed to extract the data from the XML response. Latitude, which is specified in lines 90-93, and longitude, which is specified in lines 94-97, each extract the data using a single XPath expression. The source type for each is set to XML. Mapping of a repeating structure is accomplished in a similar fashion. Lines 98-101 define the mapping for the address-information parameter. The XPath expression for address-information returns a nodeset as there are several nodes that match the expression GeocodeResponse/result/address_component. For each node that is returned, a new structure is created to contain the result of each of the submappings. Each of the submappings places its target into the newly created structure. Since the source of each of the submappings is one of the matched nodes, the mapping elements do not specify a source. It is assumed to be the inherited context. Similarly, the reference is evaluated within the context of the source, which is inherited. After each of the submappings is evaluated for a single source, the structure is added to a running list and the submappings are evaluated again for the next result in the source list. When all the sources are processed, the list that was collecting the results of the map is assigned to the address-information parameter. Localizing Service Descriptions The name and description elements allow you to localize an HCL Leap Service Description in multiple languages using duplicate elements, each with a different xml:lang attribute and contents.

You can create composite rules that govern how your form, and the data in your form behaves. With the Rules feature, you can create a dynamic user experience that ensures accurate data capture, and enforcement of business rules. Rules allow you to guide the user through the form by hiding questions, or pages, that are not relevant. Rules also allow you to enforce your business validation rules within the form to ensure that data is valid before the form is submitted. The following steps describe how to set rules that require users to enter more information depending on how the first question is answered. Rules can be set for the following conditions: Show or Hide You can set data entry items, buttons, and containers to be hidden, or visible. Enable or Disable You can set buttons and data entry items as enabled or disabled. Valid or Not Valid In a data entry item, such as a Single Line Entry field, you can set conditions on what type of information is acceptable. For example, in a timesheet application, you can set a rule that the check-out time cannot occur before a check in time. Required or Not required You can choose whether you want data entry items to be mandatory, or optional. Additional general information on Rules You can add multiple Boolean operators, such as AND, and OR, for each rule. However, you cannot mix the two conditions in a rule. You can name and rename rules. It is useful to give each rule a unique and descriptive name. If you have several rules with similar operations, a descriptive name lets you quickly find the specific rule without having to open each one to view the details. You can search rules based on form item. To set a new rule, use the Edit rules icon in each form item. You can also create rules for pages and buttons. You can use the icon to open a rule and edit it. After a rule is set, a checkmark appears on the Rule icon for the form item, as well as any form item involved in the rule. This makes it easy to see which form items are used in rules. HCL Leap warns you if you attempt to delete a form item that is used in a rule. If you agree, you delete the rule. If you duplicate a field, the rule is duplicated with it. Note: When you set rules for Number or Currency form items, you must set the default value of the form item to zero in the Properties side panel. In the Properties side panel, set the minimum value to zero. If the Number or Currency form item is blank, it does not default to zero, and any rule you set does not work properly.

First, a Service Catalog is a programmatic mechanism to dynamically provide Service Descriptions to HCL Leap instead of using static XML files. Second, a Service Catalog is linked to a Service Catalog Group and provides a mechanism to assign Service Descriptions to a specific Service Catalog Group. A Service Catalog is implemented in much the same manner as a Service Catalog Group. You first create an implementation of the IServiceCatalog interface. The recommended approach is to extend the AbstractServiceCatalog class. Your implementation and supporting files are then packaged into an OSGi bundle and deployed to the extensions directory on the Leap server. Refer to Setting up your development environment before using the following instructions. Create a Java class The following example of a custom Service Catalog provides the description of a single sample service called Hello Service. This service has one input parameter and one output parameter. This custom Service Catalog is linked with the sample Service Catalog Group described in the Service Catalog Group help topic by returning the com.mycompany.services.MyServiceCatalogGroup.id from the getGroupId() method. The Hello Service service is started when My Services is selected by the application designer from the Service Catalog dropdown in the Service Configuration dialog. package com.mycompany.services ; import com.ibm.form.nitro.service.model.* ; import com.ibm.form.nitro.service.services.* ; import java.util.* ; public class MyServiceCatalog extends AbstractServiceCatalog implements IServiceCatalog { private Collection < IServiceDescription > mServiceDescriptions = null ; public String getGroupId () { return \"com.mycompany.services.MyServiceCatalogGroup.id\" ; } public void setServiceDescriptionBuilderFactory ( IServiceDescriptionBuilderFactory pServiceDescriptionBuilderFactory ) { if ( this . mServiceDescriptions == null ) { this . mServiceDescriptions = new ArrayList < IServiceDescription > (); try { IServiceDescriptionBuilder builder1 = pServiceDescriptionBuilderFactory . newDescriptionBuilder (); builder1 . setId ( \"com.mycompany.services.Hello\" ). setDefaultLocale ( Locale .

However, IserviceDescriptionBuilder also provides methods to parse Service Descriptions from XML files. Create an OSGi Service Description You must create an .xml file to declare your Java class as an OSGi service. For example, create a MyServiceCatalog.xml file with the following content: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <scr:component xmlns:scr= \"http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/scr/v1.1.0\" configuration-policy= \"optional\" enabled= \"true\" immediate= \"true\" name= \"com.mycompany.services.MyServiceCatalog.service\" > <implementation class= \"com.mycompany.services.MyServiceCatalog\" /> <reference bind= \"setServiceDescriptionBuilderFactory\" cardinality= \"1..1\" interface= \"com.ibm.form.nitro.service.services.IServiceDescriptionBuilderFactory\" name= \"ServiceDescriptionBuilderFactory\" policy= \"static\" /> <service> <provide interface= \"com.ibm.form.nitro.service.services.IServiceCatalog\" /> </service> </scr:component> For the class attribute of the implementation element, use the fully qualified name of the Java class you created in Step 1 . Ensure that the name attribute of the component element is unique. Although not required, you can make the name attribute the same as the fully qualified name of the Java class that you created in Step 1. Notice the inclusion of the <reference> element in this example. This ensures that your custom Service Catalog has access to an IServiceDescriptionBuilderFactory for programmatically building up Service Descriptions. Create a MANIFEST.MF file Create a MANIFEST.MF file similar to Step 3 in the Service Catalog Group help topic. Multiple OSGi services can be packaged within the same OSGi bundle. Therefore, the same MANIFEST.MF file can be used for a custom Service Catalog Group and a custom Service Catalog. Deploy the Service Catalog. Deployment of your Service Catalog is similar to Step 4 in the Service Catalog Group help topic. Multiple OSGi services can be packaged within the same OSGi bundle, so the same .jar file can be used for your custom Service Catalog Group and custom Service Catalog.

First, a Service Catalog is a programmatic mechanism to dynamically provide Service Descriptions to HCL Leap instead of using static XML files. Second, a Service Catalog is linked to a Service Catalog Group and provides a mechanism to assign Service Descriptions to a specific Service Catalog Group. A Service Catalog is implemented in much the same manner as a Service Catalog Group. You first create an implementation of the IServiceCatalog interface. The recommended approach is to extend the AbstractServiceCatalog class. Your implementation and supporting files are then packaged into an OSGi bundle and deployed to the extensions directory on the Leap server. Refer to Setting up your development environment before using the following instructions. Create a Java class The following example of a custom Service Catalog provides the description of a single sample service called Hello Service. This service has one input parameter and one output parameter. This custom Service Catalog is linked with the sample Service Catalog Group described in the Service Catalog Group help topic by returning the com.mycompany.services.MyServiceCatalogGroup.id from the getGroupId() method. The Hello Service service is started when My Services is selected by the application designer from the Service Catalog dropdown in the Service Configuration dialog. package com.mycompany.services ; import com.ibm.form.nitro.service.model.* ; import com.ibm.form.nitro.service.services.* ; import java.util.* ; public class MyServiceCatalog extends AbstractServiceCatalog implements IServiceCatalog { private Collection < IServiceDescription > mServiceDescriptions = null ; public String getGroupId () { return \"com.mycompany.services.MyServiceCatalogGroup.id\" ; } public void setServiceDescriptionBuilderFactory ( IServiceDescriptionBuilderFactory pServiceDescriptionBuilderFactory ) { if ( this . mServiceDescriptions == null ) { this . mServiceDescriptions = new ArrayList < IServiceDescription > (); try { IServiceDescriptionBuilder builder1 = pServiceDescriptionBuilderFactory . newDescriptionBuilder (); builder1 . setId ( \"com.mycompany.services.Hello\" ). setDefaultLocale ( Locale .

Sample LDAP query Service Transport The following example is a more complex Service Transport that demonstrates one possible way to query an LDAP server. The transport itself remains fairly generic so that multiple different service descriptions, each with their own custom parameters and LDAP search properties, can use this same transport. This sample uses the JVM's naming services (javax.naming.directory and javax.naming.ldap) to communicate with the external LDAP server. LDAP search results are converted to XML which can then be pulled apart by the outgoing mapping section of the service description as needed. For example: <searchresults> <searchresult> <telephone> 1-555-555-555 </telephone> <email> csmith@mycompany.com </email> <cn> Chris Smith </cn> </searchresult> <searchresult> ... </searchresult> ... </searchresults> If necessary, the Basic Credentials Provider is used to collect the credentials needed to query the LDAP server.

The transport implements the service itself. package com.mycompany.services ; import com.ibm.form.nitro.service.model.IUser ; import com.ibm.form.nitro.service.services.* ; import com.ibm.form.platform.service.framework.i18n.LocaleUtils ; import java.util.* ; public class HelloServiceTransport implements IServiceTransport { public String getId () { return \"com.mycompany.services.HelloServiceTransport.id\" ; } public ServiceResult run ( IServiceDescription pDescription , IServiceCredentialsProvider pServiceCredentialsProvider , IUser pUser , Map < String , Object > pParameters ) { String personName = ( String ) pParameters . get ( \"person\" ); Locale requestLocale = LocaleUtils . getRequestLocale (); String greeting = \"\" ; if ( requestLocale . getLanguage (). equals ( Locale . FRENCH . getLanguage ())) greeting = \"Bonjour\" + personName ; else greeting = \"Hello \" + personName ; pParameters . put ( \"greeting\" , greeting ); ServiceResult result = new ServiceResult ( 200 , \"success\" ); return result ; } public Collection < IServiceDescription > getSampleServiceDescriptions () { return Collections . emptyList (); } public IServiceTransportMetadata getMetadata () { return new IServiceTransportMetadata () { public Set < String > getAllowableCredentialsProviderIds () { return Collections . emptySet (); } }; } } Create an OSGi Service Description You must create an .xml file to declare your Java class as an OSGi service. For example, create a HelloServiceTransport.xml file with the following content: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <scr:component xmlns:scr= \"http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/scr/v1.1.0\" configuration-policy= \"optional\" immediate= \"true\" name= \"com.mycompany.services.HelloServiceTransport.service\" > <implementation class= \"com.mycompany.services.HelloServiceTransport\" /> <service> <provide interface= \"com.ibm.form.nitro.service.services.IServiceTransport\" /> </service> </scr:component> For the class attribute of the implementation element, use the fully qualified name of the Java class you created in Step 1. Ensure that the name attribute of the component element is unique. Although not required, you can make it the same as the fully qualified name of the Java class that you created in Step 1. Create a MANIFEST.MF file Sample content: Manifest-Version: 1.0 Bundle-ManifestVersion: 2 Bundle-Name: My Company Services Bundle-SymbolicName: com.mycompany.services Bundle-Version: 1.0.0.b1 Bundle-Vendor: My Company Bundle-RequiredExecutionEnvironment: JavaSE-1.6 Service-Component: OSGI-INF/*.xml Import-Package: com.ibm.form.nitro.service.model, com.ibm.form.nitro.service.services, com.ibm.form.platform.service.framework.i18n Multiple OSGi services can be packaged within the same OSGi bundle. Therefore, the same MANIFEST.MF file can be used for a custom Service Transport, a custom Service Catalog Group, and a custom Service Catalog. Deploy the Service Transport. Create a .jar file that contains the Java class, OSGi Service Description, and the MANIFEST.MF, created in steps 1 - 3. For example: / META-INF/ MANIFEST.MF OSGI-INF/ HelloServiceTransport.xml com/ mycompany/ services/ HelloServiceTransport.class HelloServiceTransport$1.class Multiple OSGi services can be packaged within the same OSGi bundle. Therefore, the same .jar file can be used for a custom Service Transport, a custom Service Catalog Group, and a custom Service Catalog. On the Leap server, put the .jar file in one the following directories or in a subdirectory of one of the following directories: Windows\u2122: any drive:\\HCL\\Leap\\extensions\\ Non Windows: /opt/HCL/Leap/extensions/ Important notes on directories: If the extensions directory does not exist, then the Leap server must be restarted after the directory is created. /opt/HCL/Leap/ is not case-sensitive.","title":"Creating your own custom Service Transport"},{"location":"ser_create_custom_service_transport.html#sample-ldap-query-service-transport","text":"The following example is a more complex Service Transport that demonstrates one possible way to query an LDAP server. The transport itself remains fairly generic so that multiple different service descriptions, each with their own custom parameters and LDAP search properties, can use this same transport. This sample uses the JVM's naming services (javax.naming.directory and javax.naming.ldap) to communicate with the external LDAP server. LDAP search results are converted to XML which can then be pulled apart by the outgoing mapping section of the service description as needed. For example: <searchresults> <searchresult> <telephone> 1-555-555-555 </telephone> <email> csmith@mycompany.com </email> <cn> Chris Smith </cn> </searchresult> <searchresult> ... </searchresult> ... </searchresults> If necessary, the Basic Credentials Provider is used to collect the credentials needed to query the LDAP server.

Parent topic: Extending","title":"Adding services"},{"location":"sub_adding_stages_toc.html","text":"Adding Stages to an application It is often desirable to have an application, or form, transition through a set of phases or stages. At each stage the form might be used by different people in different roles. The form also might be presented in a slightly different manner in each stage, such as having some items or pages hidden, or in a read-only state. Each form in an HCL Leap application can have multiple stages. By default, a newly created form has two stages: Start \u2013 The initial state of every form. Once the form transitions away from the Start stage it cannot return. Submitted \u2013 A submitted form is stored in this stage. Forms in this stage may be updated by users with permission. Additional stages can be added and configured by clicking the plus (+) icon that appears when hovering over a Stage box or by clicking the Add Stage button in the Properties panel; however, the Start stage is always required and is unique. Actions Each stage can have multiple stage actions. Each stage action presents itself as a button in the form's footer area and therefore the terms \u201cstage action\u201d, and \u201cstage button\u201d are used interchangeably. There are three types of stage actions: Submit \u2013 Submits the form data, and transitions the form to the next stage. A single stage can have multiple Submit buttons. Each Submit button may have different settings, and may transition the form to a different next stage. A stage that does not have any Submit buttons will be depicted as an \"End\" stage with a red square icon, however stage buttons may be added at any time. Save Draft \u2013 Temporarily stores the form's data so the user can return later to complete the rest of the form. A single stage can have multiple Save Draft buttons. Each button may have different settings, such as a unique message for the user. A stage is not required to have a Save Draft button. For more information, see Saving work as Draft . Cancel \u2013 Returns the form to its original state before the end-user started making modifications. The form remains within the same stage. A single stage can have only one Cancel button. A stage is not required to have a Cancel button. Every newly created stage, including the Start stage, is given by default a single Submit button and Cancel button as a starting point. Activities During the transition from one stage to the next, there are several activities that can take place: Send an Email, Call a Service, and Assign Users. The Visibility tab also allows the application designer to disable or hide any form item, or entire page, within a specific stage for a particular form. Leap provides control over which users can access or modify the Form's data at any particular stage. The setting of these permissions is done by clicking on a stage and navigating to Permissions , or by clicking the Visibility tab. For more information, see Application and Security overview . Branching Each stage action may define one (or more) conditional branch by clicking on the diamond icon below the stage object in the workflow diagram, or with the action selected by clicking on + Add conditional branch . A branch defines an alternate path the form takes when submitted. A branch must define a condition that determines when it will be followed. Branch conditions may be based on a user in/not in a role or the value of an item on the form. Each branch may have its own distinct activities that are executed when followed. Editing the message a user sees upon form submission The administrator of an HCL Leap application can edit the completion message a user sees when submitting a form. Redirecting users after form submission The administrator of an HCL Leap application can add a URL that is triggered when a form is submitted. Sending an email after a user submits a form You can send email notifications to managers or other users by adding an activity to the Submit button in a form. Populating information upon form submission using a web service Web services can perform many functions, such as sending data to other forms or applications. The following instructions describe how to use a web service to add information to a form automatically after it is submitted. Assigning users to a role after submission You can dynamically assign roles to a form after form submission. Configuring behavior of a form on submission Once a user completes an HCL Leap form, you can send them to another stage of that form. Saving work as a draft Some applications cannot be completed by the user in one session. If your application is very large or complicated, you can allow users to save their work as a draft before submitting it. Scenario: hidden or read-only form items in Stages This scenario uses a Vacation Request application to describe how to use multiple Stages to make sections of a form that is either hidden, or read-only. Saving a PDF to a file location Determining where you want to save your filled PDF is useful considering how many processes \"pick up\" documents from watched folders. Designers have the option of saving the file to a specific location, as an attachment to the Leap submission record, or both.

The form also might be presented in a slightly different manner in each stage, such as having some items or pages hidden, or in a read-only state. Each form in an HCL Leap application can have multiple stages. By default, a newly created form has two stages: Start \u2013 The initial state of every form. Once the form transitions away from the Start stage it cannot return. Submitted \u2013 A submitted form is stored in this stage. Forms in this stage may be updated by users with permission. Additional stages can be added and configured by clicking the plus (+) icon that appears when hovering over a Stage box or by clicking the Add Stage button in the Properties panel; however, the Start stage is always required and is unique.","title":"Adding Stages to an application"},{"location":"sub_adding_stages_toc.html#section_gcf_vqw_rvb","text":"Each stage can have multiple stage actions. Each stage action presents itself as a button in the form's footer area and therefore the terms \u201cstage action\u201d, and \u201cstage button\u201d are used interchangeably. There are three types of stage actions: Submit \u2013 Submits the form data, and transitions the form to the next stage. A single stage can have multiple Submit buttons. Each Submit button may have different settings, and may transition the form to a different next stage. A stage that does not have any Submit buttons will be depicted as an \"End\" stage with a red square icon, however stage buttons may be added at any time. Save Draft \u2013 Temporarily stores the form's data so the user can return later to complete the rest of the form. A single stage can have multiple Save Draft buttons. Each button may have different settings, such as a unique message for the user. A stage is not required to have a Save Draft button. For more information, see Saving work as Draft . Cancel \u2013 Returns the form to its original state before the end-user started making modifications. The form remains within the same stage. A single stage can have only one Cancel button. A stage is not required to have a Cancel button. Every newly created stage, including the Start stage, is given by default a single Submit button and Cancel button as a starting point.","title":"Actions"},{"location":"sub_adding_stages_toc.html#section_rjf_wqw_rvb","text":"During the transition from one stage to the next, there are several activities that can take place: Send an Email, Call a Service, and Assign Users. The Visibility tab also allows the application designer to disable or hide any form item, or entire page, within a specific stage for a particular form. Leap provides control over which users can access or modify the Form's data at any particular stage. The setting of these permissions is done by clicking on a stage and navigating to Permissions , or by clicking the Visibility tab.

A branch defines an alternate path the form takes when submitted. A branch must define a condition that determines when it will be followed. Branch conditions may be based on a user in/not in a role or the value of an item on the form. Each branch may have its own distinct activities that are executed when followed. Editing the message a user sees upon form submission The administrator of an HCL Leap application can edit the completion message a user sees when submitting a form. Redirecting users after form submission The administrator of an HCL Leap application can add a URL that is triggered when a form is submitted. Sending an email after a user submits a form You can send email notifications to managers or other users by adding an activity to the Submit button in a form. Populating information upon form submission using a web service Web services can perform many functions, such as sending data to other forms or applications. The following instructions describe how to use a web service to add information to a form automatically after it is submitted. Assigning users to a role after submission You can dynamically assign roles to a form after form submission. Configuring behavior of a form on submission Once a user completes an HCL Leap form, you can send them to another stage of that form. Saving work as a draft Some applications cannot be completed by the user in one session. If your application is very large or complicated, you can allow users to save their work as a draft before submitting it. Scenario: hidden or read-only form items in Stages This scenario uses a Vacation Request application to describe how to use multiple Stages to make sections of a form that is either hidden, or read-only. Saving a PDF to a file location Determining where you want to save your filled PDF is useful considering how many processes \"pick up\" documents from watched folders.

The table contains limitations, best practices, and known issues. Table 1. Known limitations of Leap Limitations Resolution HCL Connections Community Surveys are not available in Leap 8.6.0 and later versions. To add Surveys to your Connections application, you must use Leap 8.5 with Connections 4.5, or Leap 8.5.1 with Connections 5.0. Form item size limitations. When building a Leap application, you must not exceed the following size limits You cannot have more than 1000 data items in your form You cannot have more than 200 data items in your form DB2\u00ae has a page size limit for tables of 32kb. Each data item in a Leap application has a size limit. For example: - Single Line \u2013 200 bytes and Multiple line - Leap uses a CLOB data type to store the value of each multiple line entry data item. The limit to the number of characters stored in a CLOB is dependent on language and character set. The English limit is approximately 1 million characters.If the content of any given multiple line field exceeds the database allowance, you see a \u201c500 Internal Server Error\u201d message, and form submission fails. The full message is stored in the system log files. - Currency/Number \u2013 8 bytes - Attachment \u2013 108 bytes - Select One and Survey \u2013 size is based on the number of choices and questions If you receive the error The row length of the table exceeded a limit of \u201c32677\u201d bytes. (Table space \u201c\u201d.). SQLCODE=-670 , your form exceeds the maximum size. You must remove items from the form, or break the application into multiple forms. It is important to note that items create database columns, and contribute to the limit even when they are hidden on the form. Note: This is no longer applicable as of DB2 10.5 and newer, due to extended row size. Limit on the number of embedded sections. When designing a form in Leap, you can embed sections within sections to achieve the wanted layout. Do not embed more than 5 sections within one another. When using more than five embedded sections, it becomes difficult to select the action icons for a specific section. Exceeding 5 sections also results in forms not rendering properly. Printing Leap content Leap provides a print button. If there is no print button in the contents of your form, the web browser print function does not work well. To print out the contents shown in your browser, uses a screen capture. For more information, see Taking a screen capture in Windows\u2122 . Adding Groups to Leap applications. Leap cannot resolve users if they are members of nested groups. For example, your company LDAP contains a super group called \u201cManagers\u201d. This super group consists of several smaller groups, such as \u201cSupervisors\u201d, and \u201cShift Leaders\u201d. In the Access tab of Leap, you must add the \u201cSupervisors\u201d, and \u201cShift Leaders\u201d as groups individually, rather than using the \u201cManagers\u201d super group. Table 2. Leap Best Practices Issue Resolution Canonical URLs versus short URL in the ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.serverURI property of the Leap_config.properties file When accessing Leap, the ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.serverURI entry setting is different from the browser address base URI. If you are using a short URL format to design your application, you must set ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.serverURI entry with the canonical URL. For example, if your short URL is http://localhost:9080/apps, the canonical URL for the user is http://hostname:9080/apps. Using two different URLs means users must sign on twice, as the short URL is replaced by the canonical URL. It is a best practice to use the canonical URL whenever possible. Web Link and Website form items. When using the Web Link or Website form items in your application, ensure that you enter the correct URL to get the runtime result. If the link goes to an external site, you must enter the URL with a URL protocol. For example, enter the URL as http://www.ibm.com, rather than www.ibm.com. - If you enter the URL with no protocol, then the URL is considered relative the current location. The prefix for the relative URL is attached, which might result in errors. - If you enter the URL with a single slash '/', it resolves to a URL relative to the root of the host. When using the Website item in a Leap the URLs entered must begin with: http://, https://, ftp://, or ftps:// Leap users and groups When using WebSphere\u00ae Application Server to directly maintain users and groups, it is important to maintain integrity between the WebSphere Application Server users and Leap. If you change a user definition in WebSphere Application Server, and that user is used in Leap, the relationship might be corrupted. The user would no longer be able to access Leap. Uploading files in Leap If an application requires supplemental files, it is a best practice to use reference URLs, rather than uploading the files directly into the application. The option to include reference URLs is available in the Upload dialog from the Settings tab. Leap Preview mode To use the Leap Preview feature, you must ensure that your browser is configured to allow all pop-up windows. If your browser does not allow pop-up windows, users cannot see the preview window. Browser cookies must be enabled. To successfully log in Leap, you must have browser cookie enabled. If you have deployed Leap with WebSphere Application Server Community Edition as your application server, you must ensure that you have only one Leap window or tab running in your browser at any time.

Parent topic: Troubleshooting","title":"Troubleshooting Leap"},{"location":"tr_troubleshooting.html#troubleshooting-hcl-leap","text":"The following table contains information to help you troubleshoot your Leap product or applications. The table contains limitations, best practices, and known issues. Table 1. Known limitations of Leap Limitations Resolution HCL Connections Community Surveys are not available in Leap 8.6.0 and later versions. To add Surveys to your Connections application, you must use Leap 8.5 with Connections 4.5, or Leap 8.5.1 with Connections 5.0. Form item size limitations. When building a Leap application, you must not exceed the following size limits You cannot have more than 1000 data items in your form You cannot have more than 200 data items in your form DB2\u00ae has a page size limit for tables of 32kb. Each data item in a Leap application has a size limit. For example: - Single Line \u2013 200 bytes and Multiple line - Leap uses a CLOB data type to store the value of each multiple line entry data item. The limit to the number of characters stored in a CLOB is dependent on language and character set. The English limit is approximately 1 million characters.If the content of any given multiple line field exceeds the database allowance, you see a \u201c500 Internal Server Error\u201d message, and form submission fails. The full message is stored in the system log files. - Currency/Number \u2013 8 bytes - Attachment \u2013 108 bytes - Select One and Survey \u2013 size is based on the number of choices and questions If you receive the error The row length of the table exceeded a limit of \u201c32677\u201d bytes. (Table space \u201c\u201d.). SQLCODE=-670 , your form exceeds the maximum size. You must remove items from the form, or break the application into multiple forms. It is important to note that items create database columns, and contribute to the limit even when they are hidden on the form. Note: This is no longer applicable as of DB2 10.5 and newer, due to extended row size. Limit on the number of embedded sections. When designing a form in Leap, you can embed sections within sections to achieve the wanted layout. Do not embed more than 5 sections within one another. When using more than five embedded sections, it becomes difficult to select the action icons for a specific section. Exceeding 5 sections also results in forms not rendering properly. Printing Leap content Leap provides a print button. If there is no print button in the contents of your form, the web browser print function does not work well. To print out the contents shown in your browser, uses a screen capture. For more information, see Taking a screen capture in Windows\u2122 . Adding Groups to Leap applications. Leap cannot resolve users if they are members of nested groups. For example, your company LDAP contains a super group called \u201cManagers\u201d. This super group consists of several smaller groups, such as \u201cSupervisors\u201d, and \u201cShift Leaders\u201d. In the Access tab of Leap, you must add the \u201cSupervisors\u201d, and \u201cShift Leaders\u201d as groups individually, rather than using the \u201cManagers\u201d super group. Table 2. Leap Best Practices Issue Resolution Canonical URLs versus short URL in the ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.serverURI property of the Leap_config.properties file When accessing Leap, the ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.serverURI entry setting is different from the browser address base URI. If you are using a short URL format to design your application, you must set ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.serverURI entry with the canonical URL. For example, if your short URL is http://localhost:9080/apps, the canonical URL for the user is http://hostname:9080/apps. Using two different URLs means users must sign on twice, as the short URL is replaced by the canonical URL. It is a best practice to use the canonical URL whenever possible. Web Link and Website form items. When using the Web Link or Website form items in your application, ensure that you enter the correct URL to get the runtime result. If the link goes to an external site, you must enter the URL with a URL protocol. For example, enter the URL as http://www.ibm.com, rather than www.ibm.com. - If you enter the URL with no protocol, then the URL is considered relative the current location. The prefix for the relative URL is attached, which might result in errors. - If you enter the URL with a single slash '/', it resolves to a URL relative to the root of the host. When using the Website item in a Leap the URLs entered must begin with: http://, https://, ftp://, or ftps:// Leap users and groups When using WebSphere\u00ae Application Server to directly maintain users and groups, it is important to maintain integrity between the WebSphere Application Server users and Leap. If you change a user definition in WebSphere Application Server, and that user is used in Leap, the relationship might be corrupted. The user would no longer be able to access Leap. Uploading files in Leap If an application requires supplemental files, it is a best practice to use reference URLs, rather than uploading the files directly into the application. The option to include reference URLs is available in the Upload dialog from the Settings tab. Leap Preview mode To use the Leap Preview feature, you must ensure that your browser is configured to allow all pop-up windows. If your browser does not allow pop-up windows, users cannot see the preview window. Browser cookies must be enabled. To successfully log in Leap, you must have browser cookie enabled. If you have deployed Leap with WebSphere Application Server Community Edition as your application server, you must ensure that you have only one Leap window or tab running in your browser at any time. Attempting to log in to multiple Leap windows or tabs results in login errors. Table 3.

Is my schema valid? Make sure that all prefixes are bound to a namespace Usually schemas contains the following namespace declarations in <xsd:schema> : xmlns:xsd=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\" targetNamespace=\"[value varies]\" xmlns:tns=\"[usually the same as targetNamespace]\" When a schema includes or imports other schemas, make sure that the schema is accessible through the @schemaLocation. If the @schemaLocation is a URL, verify that you can access the URL and that the URL is indeed a schema. If the @schemaLocation is an absolute file path verify that the .xsd file exists in that path. If the @schemaLocation is a relative file path make sure that the .xsd file exists in that path relative to where the importing schema is stored. When a WSDL file is manually retrieved from the web and stored locally, you must clearly indicate the path. If the WSDL file imports an external schema with a relative URL, you must either change the schema location to point to the full URL, or save a copy of the schema and change the schema location to point to the local copy of the schema. Is my WSDL file valid? Check namespace declarations. Usually WSDL files contaims the following namespace declarations in <wsdl:definitions> : xmlns:wsdl=\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/\" xmlns:xsd=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\" xmlns:soap=\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/soap/\" targetNamespace=\"[value varies]\" xmlns:tns=\"[usually the same as targetNamespace]\" Several WSDL file tags have an attribute @name. According to the WSDL schema, the @name is of type NCName. It is a string without any colons. For example, <wsdl:definitions name=\"ABCOrg:WebService\"> is invalid. Check the WSDL tags for case sensitivity errors. For example, <wsdl:porttype> is invalid, but <wsdl:portType> is valid. Make sure that the binding style is specified. Binding style can either be Document/Literal or RPC/Encoded. This information is declared in this style: wsdl:binding/soap:binding/@style . This example can either be Document or RPC. wsdl:binding/wsdl:operation/wsdl:input/soap:body/@used can either be Literal or Encoded. Make sure that the request URL is specified. This information is located here: wsdl:service/wsdl:port/soap:address/ @location . Make sure that for every <wsdl:port> under <wsdl:service> has a matching <wsdl:binding> . Make sure that all <wsdl:binding> has a matching <wsdl:portType> . Make sure that all <wsdl:input> and <wsdl:output> of all <wsdl:operation> under all <wsdl:portType> references a valid <wsdl:message> . Make sure that all <wsdl:message> contains at least one <wsdl:part> . If the WSDL binding style is Document/Literal, make sure that all <wsdl:part> uses @element and references an element declaration in a schema. If the WSDL binding style is RPC/Encoded, make sure that all <wsdl:part> uses @type and references an actual schema data type such as xsd:string , a schema <xsd:simpleType> , or a <xsd:complexType> .

For example, \u2026 <elem> <elem>\u2026</elem> <elem>\u2026</elem> \u2026 </elem> \u2026 Why are there missing parameters or no parameters in the generated service description? Make sure that the WSDL file has access to the schema. All imported and included schemas are accessible. Make sure that each operation has its matching messages and each message part has its matching schema declaration. For Document/Literal binding style, the message part should reference a schema element declaration. An RPC/Encoded binding style should reference a schema complex type declaration. Make sure that elements and attributes have a valid type. These types can either be a <simpleType> declaration, a <complexType> declaration, or a primitive schema data type such as xsd:string or xsd:boolean . The schema data type xsd:anyType is not mapped to a parameter. Make sure that the schema does not use <any> , <anyAttribute> or @abtract=true . If it does, you must manually add the required parameters and appropriate service mapping elements. Why does the web service respond with an Error 415 Unsupported media type? The tool assumes that the value of the constant Content-Type, which in turn is mapped as the HTTP header Content-Type. If the WSDL file uses SOAP 1.1, the Content-Type is set to text/xml. If the web service uses SOAP 1.2, then the Content-Type is set to Application/soap+xml. Why is my request-entity not being mapped correctly? By schema declaration and convention, inbound service mapping elements @targetRef are based on the inbound constant prototypicalInstance . It is constructed based on the declared schema, and for RPC/Encoded style binding, it also follows those conventions. Similarly, the outbound service mapping elements @sourceRef are based on an internally created prototypical instance, which is different from the inbound constant prototypicalInstance , but constructed in the similar fashion. Why is my targetType=STRING when I map to an XML and use XPath in my targetRef . If you use an inbound service mapping and use XPath in your targetRef , the targetType= is not set to STRING because of the service mapping element wrapper. Since <mapping target=\"request-entity\" targetType=\"XML\"> is set to XML, so all service mapping element child targetTypeType are set to STRING . Why am I getting a \u201cnamespace not binded\u201d error? Verify that all prefixes you use in all service mapping element references are binded. Namespace declarations are in the <serviceMapping> .

You can specify exactly what information you want the user to enter by selecting form items to use as the table headings. The user can add as many rows into the table as required to submit their data, but the table is contained within a predefined size on the page. In this lesson, learn how to: Add a Table to the form. Add form items as column headings in the table. Add page navigation buttons to the form. Estimated time required to complete this module: 20 minutes Add a table to the Expenses page For this tutorial, add a table for the user to submit a list of expenses. In the Manage tab, open the Expense Report application by clicking Edit. The Outline view displays all the forms and pages within an application. You can change the default names of forms and pages to more specific names. You can also move between form pages by clicking them in the Outline view. In the Outline view, click the Expenses page. The blank Expenses page is displayed. Add a section to the Expenses page, and extend it to span all columns. In the properties side panel, change the title of the section to \u201cItemized Expenses\u201d. Click the Display title bar check box so the title is displayed on the form. Expand the Specialized section of the Palette and add a Table to the form. To set the table headers, click the \u201chere\u201d link in the information window. A new child page is created for the table that stores the form items that are used as table column headers. A grid with one column and one row is displayed. Add the following form items to the Table page, either vertically, or horizontally. When the user enters data into the table, a window opens and displays the column headings as a list. If there are more column headings than space in the window, scroll bars are displayed to the user. You must decide whether you want users to scroll vertically, or horizontally, then build the column headers in that direction. Whether you build the list in the child page, the column headers are displayed horizontally in the table on the form. Expand the Common section of the Palette. Add a Date. Set the Hint to Date the expense was incurred. Add a Dropdown. In the properties side panel: set the title to \u201cType\u201d and set the hint to \u201cType of expense\u201d. Click the Edit Properties icon. Then click the Edit button in the Options: section. Enter the following options into the displayed value column, create row with the Add option icon after each: Air Travel, Car rental, Food, Hotel, Postage, Other Add a Single Line Entry. Set the Title to Description. Set the Width to Medium in the Properties side panel. Add a Currency. Set the Title to Amount. Set the Width to Short. Make all form items in the Table required by clicking the required box for each item. In the Outline view, click the Expenses page to continue building the form. On the Expenses page notice that the table headings are displayed horizontally. Expand the table to cover both columns in the grid. In the Properties side panel set the title of the table to \u201cYour Expenses\u201d. Enter a Hint. For example: Enter each itemized expense in the table. Save and preview the form. The Preview icon is located with the Save icon. When the preview is displayed, click Next to get to the Expenses page. In the validation error message window, click Continue. The error is displayed because you are leaving the first page of the form without entering data into mandatory fields. The table is then displayed with no entries. Click the Add a new entry icon to add test information to the table. A window is displayed containing the column headers displayed vertically, and they all fit in the window. If the table headers were entered onto the Table page horizontally, the user must scroll to see all table fields. Close the preview form to return to building the form. Set a formula on the table so the total of the submitted expenses is displayed in a separate Currency area. This total is supplied to the reviewer on the Approval page you create next. On the Expenses page, add a Currency form item beneath the table. Click the newly added currency field to reveal the properties side panel. Change the Title to Total Expense Amount. Click the Formula tab. From the Choose the function used to set the value of this item: select Table Sum. Click the Column entry field. A window opens for you to select a form item. Expand the tree until Amount is available. The formula is set. Add Page Navigation buttons to the end of the form. Save and preview the form. If you enter test data into the table, the numbers that are entered in the Amount columns are automatically added and displayed in the Total Expense Amount. Adding an approval page with more logic to the form The following steps describe how to create an approval page where a supervisor approves or denies the expense report. A rule is set so that if the reviewer denies the expense claim, they can provide a reason why the expense was denied. First, create a page in the form to use as the Approval page. It displays the Total Expense Amount from the Expenses page to the approver. In the Outline view, click the Add icon to add another page to the form. Change the name of the page to Approval. Add a Section and span the section across the two columns. In the properties side panel, change the title to \u201cExpense Approval\u201d, and select the Display title bar option. Add a Single Line Entry form item to the section. Change the name to Approver\u2019s Name. Add a Currency form item next. Change the title to Expense Amount to Approve Click the currency form item to reveal the properties side panel. The following substeps describe how to pull the total from the Total Expense Amount on the Expenses page into the Expense Amount to Approve form item. A rule is then set to make the amount read-only to the approver if its value is greater than zero. This way, the approver can see the amount, but cannot change it. In the properties side panel, select the Formula tab. From the Choose the function used to set the value of this item menu, select Assign. Select Total Expense Amount from the list of form items available. Click the Edit Rules icon and add a rule. In the When the following condition is true section, select Expense Amount to Approve from the first menu. Select Greater than from the second menu. Leave \u201cA fixed value\u201d selected and add the number 0 to the empty field. In the Perform this action section, select Expense Amount to Approve from the first menu. Select Disable from the second menu. Click Apply and Close. Add a Select One item in the section. Click the newly added select one to reveal the properties side panel. Set the Title to Do you approve this expense? Click the check box to make this item Required. Edit the Options: to Approve and Decline. Set the Choice Layout to Horizontal. Add a Multi-Line Entry beneath Expense Amount to Approve. Title the Multi-Line Entry: Reason for Declining: Click the Rules icon. This rule will hide this Multi-Line Entry item if the expense is approved. Click Add Rule. From the When this is true: section, select Do you approve this expense? Select Does not equal. Leave A fixed value selected and then select Approve from the next set of options. Select Reason for declining: from the Perform this action section. Select Hide from the next menu. Click Apply and Close. Add page navigation buttons to the end of the page. This set of buttons allows the user to see the comments of the approver if the Expense Report is rejected. In the next lesson, you will hide these navigation buttons, so they are displayed after the approver reviews the Expense Report. Save the form. The approval page is created, but is only used when a workflow is applied to the form. Creating a workflow with Stages is covered in the next section of the tutorial.

The approval page is created, but is only used when a workflow is applied to the form. Creating a workflow with Stages is covered in the next section of the tutorial. Parent topic: Adding tables and workflow elements to a HCL Leap form","title":"Adding an approval page with more logic to the form"},{"location":"tut_roles_and_stages_module2.html","text":"Adding workflow Stages to a form Leap uses Stages to add workflow to your form. Workflow describes various lifecycle steps that are associated with the form. Defining multiple connected Stages creates the workflow, where each stage defines its own form behavior, access rights, and navigation steps. In this tutorial, define the workflow steps that are required for the approval of the form. A Stage describes: The behavior of the form while it is in a stage, including what portions of the form are visible or read only. The flow of the form, determining navigation between stages. For example, a form goes to a manager for general expense approval, but to another manager if the amount of the expense exceeds a predefined amount. Who has access to the form while the form is in that stage. By default, each form has a Start and a Submitted stage. The Start stage is the beginning of the workflow, and describes a form that has not been completed or submitted by the user. After a form leaves the Start stage, it can never return to the Start stage. The Submitted stage describes a form that has reached the next part of the workflow. You may add other stages to your workflow to fit your use case. In this lesson, learn how to: Go to the Workflow tab. Add new stages and modify various stage properties. Make form items read-only in a specific stage. Make form pages read-only and hidden in specific stages. Set navigation between stages to create a workflow. Estimated time required to complete this module: 20 minutes Adding Stages to your form The workflow for this form is summarized as follows: The user accesses the form in the Start stage. When the user submits the form, it goes to the Awaiting Approval stage, where an approver can either accept or reject the Expense Report. If the reviewer accepts the Expense Report, the form goes to the Accepted stage. If the reviewer rejects the Expense Report, the form goes to the Approval Request stage so the submitter can make corrections and resubmit. Click the Workflow tab. The view is made of the diagram canvas and the properties side panel. In the Start stage, the user who enters data into the form does not need to see the Approval page. To ensure that the user cannot find their way to that page, hide it from view. Click the Visibility button at the top of the screen, then in the side panel, click the Hide icon for the Approval page. The Approval page is hidden from view when the form user first submits the form. Note: The hidden or read-only status applies to a form item in a particular stage. If you add another stage, the hidden or read-only status does not carry forward to the new stage. The user does not need to see the page navigation buttons to the Approval page. Hide them by clicking the Expenses page. Go to the page navigation buttons. In the properties side panel, click the eye icon to hide in this stage. The page navigation buttons are now hidden from view when the user submits the form. The page navigation buttons are only hidden in this stage. Create a stage to add the Approval page that is created in the previous section. Click the Add a new stage icon while the Start stage is in focus. A new stage is inserted after the Start stage and before the Submitted stage. Click the label \u201cStage n \u201d to change the name of the stage to \u201cApproval Request\u201d. This stage allows users to open the form again and edit the expense report if it is rejected by an approver. Click on the Visibility button at the top of the screen. Set the Approval page to read-only by clicking on the lock icon with the \u201cApproval Request\u201d stage selected. You want the user to see the comments that are written by the reviewer, but do not want the user to be able to modify the choices that are set by the reviewer. Add another stage, and title it Awaiting Approval. The form progresses to this stage after the user submits it. In the Visibility View, set the Basic Information and Expenses pages to be read-only. At the end of the form, Submit and Cancel buttons are automatically added. Click the Add Action icon, and add another Submit button. Click the Submit action on the diagram, or with the stage selected click the Edit Properties icon for the Submit button. Change the title to Accept. So users know whether their Expense Reports were accepted or rejected, send them an email. In the Action Completion Message: field, set it to read You have approved the submitter\u2019s expense report. They are notified by email of the approval. This message is shown to the approver every time they accept an expense report. Click the Activities tab. In the Activities section, click \u201c+ Add Activity\u201d to create one. Select \u201cSend an email\u201d as the Activity Type. From the To: menu, click \u201cInsert\u201d and select Email. In the Subject entry field, type Your Expense Report was accepted. In the Contents of the Email: box, write your email. For example, enter: Thank you for submitting your expense report. It was accepted, and payment will be made shortly. To view the approved report, click the following link: To insert a link to the form, click the Insert item: menu that is located in the text editor tools. From the menu, select Link to this form. The changes are automatically saved. Click the X or click outside the settings panel to close it. When the reviewer approves the expense report, the user receives an email at the address they provided on the Basic Information page. Now configure the second Submit button to use if the approver rejects the submitted form. With the stage selected, click the label for the second Submit button and change the title to \u201cDecline\u201d. In the Action Completion Message: field set it to read: You have rejected the submitter\u2019s request. They are notified to correct errors and resubmit the Expense Report. In the Next Stage: menu, select Approval Request. If the Expense Report is rejected, the user can reopen it to correct errors. Now set the stage to send an email to notify the submitter of the rejection. In the Activities section, click \u201c+ Add Activity\u201d to create one. Select \u201cSend an email\u201d as the Activity Type. From the To: menu, click \u201cInsert\u201d and select Email. In the Subject: entry field, type Your Expense Report was rejected. In the Contents of the Email: box, write your email. For example, enter: Your submitted expense report was rejected.Click the following link to review the report, make corrections and resubmit: To insert a link to the form, click the Insert item: menu in the text editor tools. From the menu, select Link to this form. The changes are automatically saved. Click the X or click outside the settings panel to close it. Go to the Approval Request stage. Set which stage the button activates by clicking on the submit button on the diagram and in the Properties side panel change the Next Stage to \u201cAwaiting Approval\u201d. When the approver receives the form to review, it is best if the submitted information is read-only. This way the reviewer cannot modify any data that the user submitted. When you set pages and form items as read-only in the Start stage, and must do so again in Approval Request stage. In the Visibility view, click the \u201cApproval Request\u201d stage and then click the lock icon next to the page to make it read-only in this stage. Now that the Approval Request stage is created, you must modify the Start stage so the form is routed to the Approval Request stage. Click the Start stage. Click the Edit Properties icon for Submit. Change the Action Completion Message: to read: Your data was submitted and will be reviewed soon. Change the Next Stage to \u201cApproval Request\u201d. Save your application. When the user completes and submits the form, it is sent to an approver for review. When the user submits the form, it goes from the Start to the Awaiting Approval stage. If the approver accepts, the form is sent to the Submitted stage, and the workflow is complete. If the approver rejects the Expense Report, it is sent to the Approval Request stage so the user can fix errors and resubmit. If the approver rejects the Expense Report, the form is sent to this stage so the user can open the form, change it, and resubmit. When the user submits the corrected form, it goes to the Awaiting Approval stage again. Optional: Applying conditional workflow to the form There is a rule on the form that states any expense reimbursement must be approved by a reviewer. However, you can create a stage in the workflow to request special approval for amounts larger than $2000. In the Workflow tab, create a stage and title it Special Approval. Create a second Submit button. Click label for the first Submit button to change the title to Accept. Set the Next stage: to Awaiting Approval. When the special request is approved, the form is sent to the main approver for review. Click label for the second Submit button to change the title to Reject. Set the Next stage: to Approval Request. Click \u201c+ Add Action\u201d in the properties side panel or hover over the stage card in the diagram and click the \u201c+\u201d to create a second submit button. Click the Edit Properties icon for new Submit button. Click the Visibility button. Click on the Actions section where the submit buttons are shown. Click the Rules icon for the new submit button. Click Add Rule. In the When this is true: section, click the menu. Select Show items on all pages. Click the same menu again and select Expense Amount to Approve. In the next menu, select Less than or equals. In the blank field for A fixed value, enter $2000. In the Perform this action section, select the second Submit button in the start stage. A number is appended to the action button ID when there are more than one instance of the same class. For example, the ID for this item is Start - Submit - S_Submit2, but a different number can be appended if you create and delete more than one Submit button. Select Hide from the next menu. Click Apply. The rule states that the button is hidden if the expense amount claimed is less than $2000. Now set the opposite rule on the first submit button. Click Add Rule. In the When this is true: section, click the menu. Select Show items on all pages. Click the same menu again and select Expense Amount to Approve. In the next menu, select Greater than or equals. In the blank field for A fixed value, enter $2000. In the Perform this action section, select the second Submit button in the start stage. A number is appended to the action button ID when there are more than one instance of the same class. For example, the ID for this item is Start - Submit - S_Submit, but a number can be appended to that string if you create and delete more than one Submit button. Select Hide from the next menu. Click Apply and Close. When the user opens the form, only one Submit button is visible. When the user clicks the Submit button, the form is sent to the appropriate stage based on the total amount of the expense. Note: Submit buttons are not available in Preview mode. You must deploy the form to test the rules that are set on the button. If you deploy the form, there is no difference in the appearance of the form because both buttons have the same name. When you click View Data, you see the additional workflow steps that are required for the form. The conditional workflow is set. In the next section, add access control to each stage so the Approval Request stage is set to one set of reviewers, while the Special Approval stage is set to another set of reviewers. Save the form.

Set which stage the button activates by clicking on the submit button on the diagram and in the Properties side panel change the Next Stage to \u201cAwaiting Approval\u201d. When the approver receives the form to review, it is best if the submitted information is read-only. This way the reviewer cannot modify any data that the user submitted. When you set pages and form items as read-only in the Start stage, and must do so again in Approval Request stage. In the Visibility view, click the \u201cApproval Request\u201d stage and then click the lock icon next to the page to make it read-only in this stage. Now that the Approval Request stage is created, you must modify the Start stage so the form is routed to the Approval Request stage. Click the Start stage. Click the Edit Properties icon for Submit. Change the Action Completion Message: to read: Your data was submitted and will be reviewed soon. Change the Next Stage to \u201cApproval Request\u201d. Save your application. When the user completes and submits the form, it is sent to an approver for review. When the user submits the form, it goes from the Start to the Awaiting Approval stage. If the approver accepts, the form is sent to the Submitted stage, and the workflow is complete. If the approver rejects the Expense Report, it is sent to the Approval Request stage so the user can fix errors and resubmit. If the approver rejects the Expense Report, the form is sent to this stage so the user can open the form, change it, and resubmit. When the user submits the corrected form, it goes to the Awaiting Approval stage again.","title":"Adding Stages to your form"},{"location":"tut_roles_and_stages_module2.html#applyingconditionallogictoastage","text":"There is a rule on the form that states any expense reimbursement must be approved by a reviewer.

Assign users to Stages. Estimated time that is required to complete this module: 20 minutes Applying access control through Roles Access control defines who is able to view and modify the form in different stages. For example, only the form administrator can change the layout of the form, while user access is restricted to opening and submitting the form. Creating this access control is done with Roles. By default, the Access tab, three roles are already defined for you: Administrator \u2013 Users, or groups, with administrator privileges for an application. Initiator \u2013 Any user, or group, who can submit a form or initiate an application. You can set some applications to be available to all users, and some to be available to specific users, or groups. Record Owner \u2013 The user who submits the form. After a user initiates and submits a form, they become the Record Owner. Each role can be either Open or Closed. When a role is Open, it dynamically assigns users at run time. When a role is Closed, the users must be set on the Access screen, and are static. For example, in a form, you might have employees sign in and enter their names and employee numbers. If the role is Open, the application can pull information about the employees\u2019 superior from a company database and populate the form. For this tutorial, all roles must remain Closed. The users who submit Expense Reports are Initiators, and for this scenario the users who review the Expense Reports are Human Resources. As the Initiator role is already created, you must create the Human Resources role. Click the Access tab. Click the Add Role icon for the Record Owner role. A new role is created. Rename the new role Human Resources. Now that the roles are created, add members to the roles. Adding members to the roles determines who can access the application. There are four predefined user groups: All Authenticated Users : Any user who is authenticated with your organization. Users must sign in with a user ID and password to access the application. Anonymous Users : Any user who you want to work anonymously with the application. Anyone who has the link to the application can submit it, without signing in. Invited Users : Any anonymous user who receives a unique URL generated from within stages when an application changes from one stage to another. A user who is not normally given access to the form in that stage can use that URL to participate in the workflow in that instance. Instance Creator : The user who submitted a form. You can also add your own Groups or Individual users to a role. In the Assign Users menu, select Initiator. The Initiator role automatically has All Authenticated Users added. Access for this role is complete. Select Human Resources from the Assign Users menu. In the Individual Users field, add your own name. As you manually enter Individual Users or Groups, Leap provides you with predictive matches based on your entry. These predictive matches are taken from your company LDAP, users that are configured in your IBM\u00ae WebSphere\u00ae Application Server, or IBM WebSphere Portal Server. By adding your name to the Human Resources Group, you are able to enter sample data into the form, and review all submitted responses. Click Add User icon. Now that access to submit and review a form is set, edit the properties of the individual roles. For example, you want Human Resources to review and approve the form, but the form must be read-only unless it is returned to the user. Remember the order of the workflow for our form: When the user submits the form, it moves from the Start stage to the Awaiting Approval stage. If a form is rejected because of errors, it is sent to the Approval Request stage, so the submitter can correct the errors and submit the form again. Go to Stage SettingsExpense Report, and select Start. You see that the Initiator has permission to Create and submit the form. Go to Stage SettingsExpense Report, and select Approval Request. For the Administrator, make Read and Delete are selected. These permissions give the Administrator the ability to see and delete submitted forms in this stage, but not to change the submitted data. For Record Owner, ensure Read and Update are selected. These permissions allow the person who submitted the form to edit the form in the case of errors, and submit it again for approval. For Human Resources, ensure the Read is enabled. Go to Stage SettingsExpense Report, and select Awaiting Approval . For the Administrator, make Read and Delete are selected. For Record Owner, ensure Read is selected. This permission allows the person who submitted the form to see it, but not change any data. For Human Resources, select Read, and Update. Although the information submitted by the user is read-only for the approver in Human Resources, the word Update is used to manage access settings. In this instance, the word Update means that an approver can use the Submit and Cancel buttons on the form. Update does NOT mean that the approver can update or manipulate the submitted data. Save the application. Click the Manage tab and deploy the application and enter sample data into the form. After you submit sample data, return to the form and click View Data from the Manage tab.

Every morning in the break room, you hear coworkers complain about the coffee, but nothing is being done to improve the coffee at work. Your Office Manager asks you to find out how your coworkers would like the coffee services changed. You must poll everyone in the office to get their opinions. Your options: Email Send out an email to all your coworkers and ask them to provide their opinions on the coffee and how it can be improved. If you send out a mass email, sporadic responses from people arrive throughout the day, cluttering up your inbox. You must then take the feedback from the emails and collate it in a spreadsheet program, and there is no easy way to track who did not answer. Create a survey Create a survey form in Leap. You email the survey link to your coworkers, and they go online to provide you with feedback. All results are stored in a database and are easy to review and sort, and your email inbox is not filled with the sporadic responses. Creating a survey is the option that you select. Note: Throughout the Leap documentation, the words \u201cform\u201d and \u201capplication\u201d are both used to describe the output that is created by Leap. Forms are a single page, or collection of pages, that create the user interface with which people interact. When a form is combined with workflow, presentation logic and other elements of the Leap technology, it becomes an application. Applications gather information that is submitted by users when they complete the form, and automatically store the submissions in a database. Estimated time that is required to complete this module: 50 - 60 minutes Opening Leap and building a form The following steps describe how to open a new Leap application and build a form. You want your coffee feedback to have: An area that contains the title of the form, and a description of the purpose of the form. Include the amount of time that is needed to complete the form. An area that contains the name of the submitter. Also included in this area if the form is the basic question: \"Do you drink the coffee that is brewed in the office?\" An area that contains the survey questions. Creating an application \u2013 When you start Leap, a screen is displayed with two tabs on the Forms toolbar: Use and Manage. The Use tab displays a list of all applications that are created by other users to which you have access. The Manage tab is where you create and manage applications. Click New Application. Enter a descriptive Application Name and Application Description, and select Create. A blank form with a two-by-two grid is displayed. The grid automatically aligns form items with one another when you place them on the form, and expands as you add form items. You can add and delete columns and rows as needed by clicking the border bar surrounding the grid. Note: As you add sections and form items to the form, the grid automatically expands to include the additional form items. You can add extra rows to your form manually, but it is not required. If there are empty rows or columns in a completed form, they are not displayed when the form is previewed or deployed. When you design forms, there are two ways to add form items to your form: You can drag form items from the Palette onto the form You can select a location on the grid, then click a form item. The form item is placed into the grid location. You can build forms by placing form items directly on the form or grouping form items in Sections. For our coffee feedback form, we use Sections to organize the form items. Sections are useful for the following reasons: They group form items in a way that is easy for the user to understand. When the form is viewed, the sections have specific background colors that are based on the style that is applied to the form. They make applying complex form functionality easier. For example, our form has a rule to hide the survey until the user selects a specific option. Instead of setting the rule on every form item individually, the rule is on the section. The rule applies to every form item within the section. They allow the form designer, and the form user, to collapse and expand entire parts of the form. In longer forms, collapsing sections is useful, as it keeps the form submitter from being overwhelmed by too much information. If you finish building your form and decide to change the layout, moving sections of form items is much easier than moving each form item individually. Creating the general information area: The general information area contains the title of the survey, more information for the form submitter, and an estimated time for completion. Drag a Section onto the form. The Section is placed into the grid area, and is highlighted to show the section has focus. Notice that the Section contains a grid within it. Form items for a section are added to the grid of the section. Click the field spanning handle and drag it to extend the section over both columns. You can resize any form item to span across multiple rows or columns. Click a grid box, then select Image from the Palette. The image form item is added to the form. You can edit many form items directly on the form, but others require you to use the Properties side panel. To display the list of available options for any form item, click the item on the canvas. The Properties side panel opens. Click Add file, then Browse to locate the logo of your company. If you do not have a logo, browse to a small resolution image on your computer. Click Open to select the image, and OK to close the Add File or URL Link window. The image is added to the form. Add a Text item to the Image. This text item contains the name of the survey. In the Size menu, set the font size to Large, then and Bold. Type Workplace Coffee Feedback and click OK. The formatted text is inserted into the form. Note: You can adjust the spacing between form items by dragging the slider in the border bar. The mouse changes to a slider, and you can adjust the proportions of the form items. Add another Text item with the image. Using the field spanning handle, drag the form item to span both columns. Enter the following text: We\u2019d like your feedback on coffee services in the office. Complete the survey to provide your feedback. Time to complete survey: 3 minutes or less. Click OK to add the text to the form. Save the form, either by pressing Ctrl + S, or by clicking the Save icon. Creating the primary information area: Now, create the section that collects the name of the submitter, and asks the basic question of \u201cDo you drink the office coffee?\u201d You want to have 100% participation, but not everyone in the office might drink coffee. By allowing users to submit the survey with a negative response, you receive a complete set of data. Set a rule on the survey section to ask coffee-relevant questions only if the submitter indicates that they drink the office coffee. Add another Section to the form. Click the field spanning handle and drag it to extend the section over both columns. Click a grid box, then click Single Line Entry. The Single Line Entry is placed onto the form. Edit the title of the Single Line Entry directly on the form. Click the title of the item: \u201cSingle Line Entry\u201d. The text is highlighted, and is now editable. Change the text to read: Your Name. Click Add hint... and type \u201cEnter your given name and surname.\u201d The hint is displayed directly on the form. Tip: Adding information to the hint fields gives more information that helps the user complete your form. For example, in this form, you ask for the user name. The hint helps clarify whether you want given name and surname, given name only, or given , middle, and surname. You can also provide more clarification for users by inserting place holder text into each Single Line Entry item. Place holder text is available in the Properties side panel, and is available for any form item where the user must type information. For example, Single Line, Multi-Line, Currency, Number, and Email. In the Single Line Entry on the canvas, click the box that is labeled Click to set as required. Users must complete this field to submit the form. Select Select One from the Palette and put it in a grid area with the Your Name text item. The Properties side panel opens. Change the Title: to Do you drink the office coffee? Click the Required check box to make this question mandatory. In the Options: section, one option is automatically available. To add another option, click the Add option plus sign. Set the options to: Yes No, I drink other hot beverages. No, I don\u2019t drink hot beverages. Displayed Value and Saved Value \u2013 When you use any form item that has Set Options, two fields are displayed: Displayed Value and Saved value. As you type in the Displayed Value, the Saved Value is automatically updated with the same value. There are some cases where the Saved Value differs from the Displayed Value. For example, our Displayed Value questions are long. If you export the data from a Leap application to a spreadsheet, the selected answers are truncated and the data might be difficult to interpret. If you change the Saved Values of the three questions to \u201cYes\u201d, \u201cOther\u201d, and \u201cNo\u201d, or assign numerical values, the results are easier to understand. Click OK. Save your form and preview it. The Preview icon is located with the Save icon. Note: Ensure that your browser does not block pop-up windows, as the preview form opens in a new window or new tab, depending on your browser settings. Notice that the Submit and Cancel buttons are automatically added for you. While you can enter data into the form in Preview mode, you cannot submit a form until it is deployed. To return to building the form, close the tab or the browser window in which the preview opened. Creating the survey: Now create the section which contains the survey questions. This section has a rule set on it, so if the user selects \u201cNo, I drink other hot beverages\u201d or \u201cNo, I don\u2019t drink hot beverages\u201d, the survey is not displayed. First create the rule, then add the survey to the section. Click the border bar to access the row action menu. Select Insert Row (after). Click Section from the Palette, then click the form. Extend the section over both columns. Click the Rules icon. The Rules window opens. Click Add Rule. In the When this is true: section, select Do you drink coffee?. Set the operation to Does not equal. Leave A fixed value in the next menu and select Yes. In the Perform this action section, select Survey in the first menu. As you build the rule, it is automatic error checking is performed. If there is an error in the logic, either a warning sign or an error sign is displayed. As this rule contains no errors, a verification icon is displayed. Select Hide in the second menu. Click Apply and Close to save your changes and close the Rules window. The rule is now set so when a user responds that they don't drink coffee, they are not shown the survey about what type of coffee they prefer. Now that the rule is set, add the survey questions using: Two Survey form items: one to ask what roast of coffee the employees prefer, the other to ask them questions about the coffee provided. A Select Many form item to provide more information about what they like or dislike about the coffee. A Multi-Line Entry form item to provide detailed comments. Select Survey from the Palette and add it to the section grid. Extend the survey over both columns. Set the following properties in the side panel: Title: \u2013 Coffee preference Hint: \u2013 What type of coffee roast do you prefer? Options: Dark Roast Medium Roast Light Roast Decaf Click OK. Change the survey question from the default \u201cClick to edit\u201d to I prefer to drink: Select Survey from the Palette and add it with the Coffee preference survey. Extend the survey over both columns. In the Properties panel, set the following properties: Title: \u2013 Please rank each question: Options: Displayed Value Saved Value Totally agree 5 Somewhat agree 4 Agree 3 No opinion 0 Somewhat disagree 2 Totally disagree 1 If you export the data to a spreadsheet program, each user\u2019s response displays as the numerical code, rather than the Displayed Value. Tabulation of results is easier as you can sort the submitted responses by Saved Value numerical indicator. Review the ranking labels. Ranking labels are displayed before and after the Displayed Value. Set the following properties: Select Display before and after labels. In the Before label: text box, typeAgree. In the After label: text box, typeDisagree. Change the survey question from the default \u201cClick to edit\u201d to: I like the coffee at work. Click Add question to add another row to the survey. Change the survey question to: If changes were made, I would drink more coffee. You can repeat this step to add more questions to the survey. An alternative to multiple survey questions is to add a Select Many form item where users can select multiple choices from a list. Click Select Many from the Palette and place it onto the form near the survey. Extend the Select Many form item over both columns. The properties panel opens. Note: You can change the orientation of the Select Many choices by changing the Choice Layout. Changes are made instantly on the form. You can also select a minimum and maximum number of choices the user can select. Set the following properties: Title: \u2013 I find the coffee in the office: Hint: \u2013 Select all that apply. Options: Too acidic Too bitter Too weak Too strong Goes cold too quickly Too gritty Perfect. No changes required. For example, you can require the user to select a minimum of two choices and a maximum of 5. Click OK. Save the form. To complete the survey form, add a Multi-Line Entry so users can submit other options, or opinions. Click Multi-Line Entry from the Palette and place it onto the form with the Select Many form item. Extend the Multi-Line Entry form item over both columns. The properties panel opens. Set the following properties: Title: \u2013 Please enter any specific suggestions you might have: Width: \u2013 Full width. Selecting Full width results in the space for entering data automatically adjusting to the size of the form in the browser window. Hint: \u2013 For example, a specific bean blend you\u2019d like us to try. Click OK. The functionality of the survey is now in place. When users complete the survey and submit it, they receive a visual confirmation on the screen that the survey is submitted, and by default, are shown the survey again. To prevent user confusion, and to prevent the user from submitting the form again, redirect the user to your company website after the form is submitted. Adding a redirect URL is done in the Workflow tab. By default, each form automatically has a Start stage and a Submitted stage. The Start stage contains the Submit and Cancel buttons that are seen when you preview the form. Click the Workflow tab. Click the Submit button node. The Properties panel opens. The Action Completion Message: has \u201cYour data has been successfully submitted.\u201d as the default message. You can leave the default, or change the text. In the Action Completion Redirect URL (optional): text entry area, enter the URL of your company website. Click the Design tab to return to the main body of the form. The coffee survey is now complete. Save and preview the form. Now that you have built a form, you must deploy it so it is available for users. Application management The following steps describe how to deploy a completed form, launch a form, enter sample data, review the submitted sample data, then delete the submitted sample data. Deploying an application \u2013 Deploying, or publishing forms is done in the Manage tab. Click the Manage tab. Click the Deploy link for your survey. The Deployment Settings window is displayed. Select Set deployment Period. Set the Start and Stop dates to span a two week window, starting today. Tip: It is useful to have a start and end date for some applications because users are forced to complete the form within a specific time frame. Click Start. The application is deployed. After the application is deployed, you need the URL to provide to your colleagues so they can complete the survey. There are two ways to get the URL: Click the Launch link. A browser window launches with the URL of the deployed form in the address bar. Notice that the Submit button on the end of the form is now available. Expand the information for the Coffee Feedback application by clicking the Show application details button for application. The link is provided on the screen in the URL Links section. Copy the URL for distribution to your coworkers. Updating an application after deployment \u2013 You can change an application at any time. However, you must deploy the application again for users to see your changes. There are two ways to change a deployed application: Update the deployed application, or stop the deployment, and then redeploy. To update a deployed application, in the Manage tab click the Edit link. A message is displayed to warn you that changing an application after it is deployed can affect previously collected data. Click Yes on the warning message. The form opens and is available for editing. Make the required changes to the form. Save the form again. Click the Manage tab, then click the Deploy link. Click Update. The application is redeployed with the updated form. You can also stop the deployment manually, make changes, then redeploy the application. If a deployment is stopped, the application is no longer available online. To stop a deployed application, click the Deploy link. The Deployment Settings window opens Click Stop. Note: If a user is completing the form when you stop, redeploy, or update an application, they receive an error message. The unsubmitted data is lost and the user must fill the form in again. Adding sample data to an application \u2013 Now that the form is complete and deployed, add some sample data. Click the Launch link. The application opens in a new browser window. Submit the form several times with various sample data. Here are some examples to try, but you can use your own combination of survey results. John Smith who drinks the office coffee. He prefers dark roast, and does not enjoy the office coffee because it is too weak and cold. Mary Jones who drinks only tea. Sam Wesson who drinks the office coffee. He likes a medium roast and like the coffee the way it is. He would like management to try a different roast combination by a local roast house. Ellen Steele who drinks the coffee, but prefers decaffeinated coffee. She would like the coffee to be weaker. Note: As you submit each survey, you see a message upon completion, and then are redirected to the company website. Viewing submitted data \u2013 After the sample data is added, return to Leap to review the submitted data. In the Manage tab, click the View Data link. The View Data screen is displayed in either a new tab or a new browser window, depending on your browser settings. On the View Data page, all submitted responses are summarized in a chart. Click Sam Wesson\u2019s name. His submitted form is displayed in the Application view. Deleting sample data \u2013 Now that you tested the form, it is highly recommended that you delete all sample responses to avoid interference with the actual data from your coworkers. There are two ways to delete the sample data: Delete individual entries from the View Data screen Update the deployment to delete previous records. To delete submitted data from the View Data screen: Select a sample record from the list so it is displayed in the Application view window. If the form is wider than the allotted screen space, scroll bars are displayed. Click Delete Record in the Application view window. Note: Clicking the x in that window closes the record, but does not delete it. To delete submitted data by updating the deployment: Close the View Data tab or browser window. You are on the Leap Manage screen. Click Deploy. The Deployment Settings window opens. Click the Advanced tab. Select the check box for Delete previous submissions. You are asked to confirm the deletion of the submitted data. Click OK. Click Update. Click the View Data link. The blank View Data page is displayed. The survey form is complete and ready to send to your coworkers. You can send out the survey link in an office-wide email. After two weeks, the survey deployment period ends, and you provide the survey results to the Office Manager.

In the first section, Opening Leap and building a form, learn how to: Open a new application Add form items to the form Resize form items Edit the properties of a form item Set a rule so form items are hidden or visible on the form Make form items mandatory Redirect users after form submission Save the form Preview a form during the design phase In the second section, Application Management, learn how to: Deploy an application Launch an application Enter sample data into the application Review the submitted sample data Delete submitted sample data The scenario: The coffee services in your office are not ideal. Every morning in the break room, you hear coworkers complain about the coffee, but nothing is being done to improve the coffee at work. Your Office Manager asks you to find out how your coworkers would like the coffee services changed. You must poll everyone in the office to get their opinions. Your options: Email Send out an email to all your coworkers and ask them to provide their opinions on the coffee and how it can be improved. If you send out a mass email, sporadic responses from people arrive throughout the day, cluttering up your inbox. You must then take the feedback from the emails and collate it in a spreadsheet program, and there is no easy way to track who did not answer. Create a survey Create a survey form in Leap. You email the survey link to your coworkers, and they go online to provide you with feedback. All results are stored in a database and are easy to review and sort, and your email inbox is not filled with the sporadic responses. Creating a survey is the option that you select. Note: Throughout the Leap documentation, the words \u201cform\u201d and \u201capplication\u201d are both used to describe the output that is created by Leap. Forms are a single page, or collection of pages, that create the user interface with which people interact. When a form is combined with workflow, presentation logic and other elements of the Leap technology, it becomes an application. Applications gather information that is submitted by users when they complete the form, and automatically store the submissions in a database. Estimated time that is required to complete this module: 50 - 60 minutes","title":"Building a survey with Leap"},{"location":"tut_survey_application_module1.html#lesson11","text":"The following steps describe how to open a new Leap application and build a form. You want your coffee feedback to have: An area that contains the title of the form, and a description of the purpose of the form. Include the amount of time that is needed to complete the form. An area that contains the name of the submitter. Also included in this area if the form is the basic question: \"Do you drink the coffee that is brewed in the office?\" An area that contains the survey questions. Creating an application \u2013 When you start Leap, a screen is displayed with two tabs on the Forms toolbar: Use and Manage. The Use tab displays a list of all applications that are created by other users to which you have access. The Manage tab is where you create and manage applications. Click New Application. Enter a descriptive Application Name and Application Description, and select Create. A blank form with a two-by-two grid is displayed. The grid automatically aligns form items with one another when you place them on the form, and expands as you add form items. You can add and delete columns and rows as needed by clicking the border bar surrounding the grid. Note: As you add sections and form items to the form, the grid automatically expands to include the additional form items. You can add extra rows to your form manually, but it is not required. If there are empty rows or columns in a completed form, they are not displayed when the form is previewed or deployed. When you design forms, there are two ways to add form items to your form: You can drag form items from the Palette onto the form You can select a location on the grid, then click a form item. The form item is placed into the grid location. You can build forms by placing form items directly on the form or grouping form items in Sections. For our coffee feedback form, we use Sections to organize the form items. Sections are useful for the following reasons: They group form items in a way that is easy for the user to understand. When the form is viewed, the sections have specific background colors that are based on the style that is applied to the form. They make applying complex form functionality easier. For example, our form has a rule to hide the survey until the user selects a specific option. Instead of setting the rule on every form item individually, the rule is on the section. The rule applies to every form item within the section. They allow the form designer, and the form user, to collapse and expand entire parts of the form. In longer forms, collapsing sections is useful, as it keeps the form submitter from being overwhelmed by too much information. If you finish building your form and decide to change the layout, moving sections of form items is much easier than moving each form item individually. Creating the general information area: The general information area contains the title of the survey, more information for the form submitter, and an estimated time for completion. Drag a Section onto the form. The Section is placed into the grid area, and is highlighted to show the section has focus. Notice that the Section contains a grid within it. Form items for a section are added to the grid of the section. Click the field spanning handle and drag it to extend the section over both columns. You can resize any form item to span across multiple rows or columns. Click a grid box, then select Image from the Palette. The image form item is added to the form. You can edit many form items directly on the form, but others require you to use the Properties side panel. To display the list of available options for any form item, click the item on the canvas. The Properties side panel opens. Click Add file, then Browse to locate the logo of your company. If you do not have a logo, browse to a small resolution image on your computer. Click Open to select the image, and OK to close the Add File or URL Link window. The image is added to the form. Add a Text item to the Image. This text item contains the name of the survey. In the Size menu, set the font size to Large, then and Bold. Type Workplace Coffee Feedback and click OK. The formatted text is inserted into the form. Note: You can adjust the spacing between form items by dragging the slider in the border bar. The mouse changes to a slider, and you can adjust the proportions of the form items. Add another Text item with the image. Using the field spanning handle, drag the form item to span both columns. Enter the following text: We\u2019d like your feedback on coffee services in the office. Complete the survey to provide your feedback. Time to complete survey: 3 minutes or less. Click OK to add the text to the form. Save the form, either by pressing Ctrl + S, or by clicking the Save icon. Creating the primary information area: Now, create the section that collects the name of the submitter, and asks the basic question of \u201cDo you drink the office coffee?\u201d You want to have 100% participation, but not everyone in the office might drink coffee. By allowing users to submit the survey with a negative response, you receive a complete set of data. Set a rule on the survey section to ask coffee-relevant questions only if the submitter indicates that they drink the office coffee. Add another Section to the form. Click the field spanning handle and drag it to extend the section over both columns. Click a grid box, then click Single Line Entry. The Single Line Entry is placed onto the form. Edit the title of the Single Line Entry directly on the form. Click the title of the item: \u201cSingle Line Entry\u201d. The text is highlighted, and is now editable. Change the text to read: Your Name. Click Add hint... and type \u201cEnter your given name and surname.\u201d The hint is displayed directly on the form. Tip: Adding information to the hint fields gives more information that helps the user complete your form. For example, in this form, you ask for the user name. The hint helps clarify whether you want given name and surname, given name only, or given , middle, and surname. You can also provide more clarification for users by inserting place holder text into each Single Line Entry item. Place holder text is available in the Properties side panel, and is available for any form item where the user must type information. For example, Single Line, Multi-Line, Currency, Number, and Email. In the Single Line Entry on the canvas, click the box that is labeled Click to set as required. Users must complete this field to submit the form. Select Select One from the Palette and put it in a grid area with the Your Name text item. The Properties side panel opens. Change the Title: to Do you drink the office coffee? Click the Required check box to make this question mandatory. In the Options: section, one option is automatically available. To add another option, click the Add option plus sign. Set the options to: Yes No, I drink other hot beverages. No, I don\u2019t drink hot beverages. Displayed Value and Saved Value \u2013 When you use any form item that has Set Options, two fields are displayed: Displayed Value and Saved value. As you type in the Displayed Value, the Saved Value is automatically updated with the same value. There are some cases where the Saved Value differs from the Displayed Value. For example, our Displayed Value questions are long. If you export the data from a Leap application to a spreadsheet, the selected answers are truncated and the data might be difficult to interpret. If you change the Saved Values of the three questions to \u201cYes\u201d, \u201cOther\u201d, and \u201cNo\u201d, or assign numerical values, the results are easier to understand. Click OK. Save your form and preview it. The Preview icon is located with the Save icon. Note: Ensure that your browser does not block pop-up windows, as the preview form opens in a new window or new tab, depending on your browser settings. Notice that the Submit and Cancel buttons are automatically added for you. While you can enter data into the form in Preview mode, you cannot submit a form until it is deployed. To return to building the form, close the tab or the browser window in which the preview opened. Creating the survey: Now create the section which contains the survey questions. This section has a rule set on it, so if the user selects \u201cNo, I drink other hot beverages\u201d or \u201cNo, I don\u2019t drink hot beverages\u201d, the survey is not displayed. First create the rule, then add the survey to the section. Click the border bar to access the row action menu. Select Insert Row (after). Click Section from the Palette, then click the form. Extend the section over both columns. Click the Rules icon. The Rules window opens. Click Add Rule. In the When this is true: section, select Do you drink coffee?. Set the operation to Does not equal. Leave A fixed value in the next menu and select Yes. In the Perform this action section, select Survey in the first menu. As you build the rule, it is automatic error checking is performed. If there is an error in the logic, either a warning sign or an error sign is displayed. As this rule contains no errors, a verification icon is displayed. Select Hide in the second menu. Click Apply and Close to save your changes and close the Rules window. The rule is now set so when a user responds that they don't drink coffee, they are not shown the survey about what type of coffee they prefer. Now that the rule is set, add the survey questions using: Two Survey form items: one to ask what roast of coffee the employees prefer, the other to ask them questions about the coffee provided. A Select Many form item to provide more information about what they like or dislike about the coffee. A Multi-Line Entry form item to provide detailed comments. Select Survey from the Palette and add it to the section grid. Extend the survey over both columns. Set the following properties in the side panel: Title: \u2013 Coffee preference Hint: \u2013 What type of coffee roast do you prefer? Options: Dark Roast Medium Roast Light Roast Decaf Click OK. Change the survey question from the default \u201cClick to edit\u201d to I prefer to drink: Select Survey from the Palette and add it with the Coffee preference survey. Extend the survey over both columns. In the Properties panel, set the following properties: Title: \u2013 Please rank each question: Options: Displayed Value Saved Value Totally agree 5 Somewhat agree 4 Agree 3 No opinion 0 Somewhat disagree 2 Totally disagree 1 If you export the data to a spreadsheet program, each user\u2019s response displays as the numerical code, rather than the Displayed Value. Tabulation of results is easier as you can sort the submitted responses by Saved Value numerical indicator. Review the ranking labels. Ranking labels are displayed before and after the Displayed Value. Set the following properties: Select Display before and after labels. In the Before label: text box, typeAgree. In the After label: text box, typeDisagree. Change the survey question from the default \u201cClick to edit\u201d to: I like the coffee at work. Click Add question to add another row to the survey. Change the survey question to: If changes were made, I would drink more coffee. You can repeat this step to add more questions to the survey. An alternative to multiple survey questions is to add a Select Many form item where users can select multiple choices from a list. Click Select Many from the Palette and place it onto the form near the survey. Extend the Select Many form item over both columns. The properties panel opens. Note: You can change the orientation of the Select Many choices by changing the Choice Layout. Changes are made instantly on the form. You can also select a minimum and maximum number of choices the user can select. Set the following properties: Title: \u2013 I find the coffee in the office: Hint: \u2013 Select all that apply. Options: Too acidic Too bitter Too weak Too strong Goes cold too quickly Too gritty Perfect. No changes required. For example, you can require the user to select a minimum of two choices and a maximum of 5. Click OK. Save the form. To complete the survey form, add a Multi-Line Entry so users can submit other options, or opinions. Click Multi-Line Entry from the Palette and place it onto the form with the Select Many form item. Extend the Multi-Line Entry form item over both columns. The properties panel opens. Set the following properties: Title: \u2013 Please enter any specific suggestions you might have: Width: \u2013 Full width. Selecting Full width results in the space for entering data automatically adjusting to the size of the form in the browser window. Hint: \u2013 For example, a specific bean blend you\u2019d like us to try. Click OK. The functionality of the survey is now in place. When users complete the survey and submit it, they receive a visual confirmation on the screen that the survey is submitted, and by default, are shown the survey again. To prevent user confusion, and to prevent the user from submitting the form again, redirect the user to your company website after the form is submitted. Adding a redirect URL is done in the Workflow tab. By default, each form automatically has a Start stage and a Submitted stage. The Start stage contains the Submit and Cancel buttons that are seen when you preview the form. Click the Workflow tab. Click the Submit button node. The Properties panel opens. The Action Completion Message: has \u201cYour data has been successfully submitted.\u201d as the default message. You can leave the default, or change the text. In the Action Completion Redirect URL (optional): text entry area, enter the URL of your company website. Click the Design tab to return to the main body of the form. The coffee survey is now complete. Save and preview the form. Now that you have built a form, you must deploy it so it is available for users.","title":"Opening Leap and building a form"},{"location":"tut_survey_application_module1.html#lesson12","text":"The following steps describe how to deploy a completed form, launch a form, enter sample data, review the submitted sample data, then delete the submitted sample data.

The Events tab displays all JavaScript used within an application. A new Alterntative text tag for Image and Media form items. To increase the accessibility of your form, you can now add alternative text to the Image and Media form items. You can now import a list of choices from a spreadsheet into Select One , Select Many , and Dropdown form items. The lists can be comma separated, or space separated. If you copy two columns of choices from a spreadsheet, the first column is set as the Displayed Value, and the second column set as the Saved Value. In the Settings tab, under Files , you can now download any previously uploaded file. A Java 2 Connector (J2C) provider is now supported for use in the HTTP Service Transport with . A new openURL query parameter so you can dynamically set a application to open at run time. The Media form item is supported in Google Chrome via HTML5. Two new JavaScript functions were added to the User Interface Objects: setTabTitle and setTabTitleList . The amount of Stage Action data an application can have has been increased. General and security fixes. 8.6.1 Support for the following versions: Oracle 11g 10.5 8.5.5 Java 7 Derby 10.10.2 New features include: Document Integration : Where compliance or regulatory requirements mandate it, integrating captured data with existing documents can be an important part of the overall solution. These output documents can be provided for precise printing, document signing or archiving. Using a Service Configuration, you can map form items to PDF items. When the user clicks a button, the PDF is populated. For more information, see Leap document integration . Integration features Render parameters : Two public render parameters were added to provide additional portlet-to-portlet communication. Page refresh setting : A new page refresh setting is available in the Shared Settings . This property lets you set whether the portal page is refreshed when the form is submitted. Support for non-default portal context root : The Leap Portlet now supports portal with a non-default context root, or an empty context root. Script Portlet and DDC samples : Two new samples are available for usingwith . Both samples are available on the developerWorks\u00ae wiki. Additional in-product help : If you're new to , blue help bubbles describe the basic function of each page or section, as well as provide additional help resources. Additional hover help, and context sensitive help were added throughout the application. JSON is now supported in the : HTTP Transport JavaScript Data Access Rest API New JavaScript functionality : New JavaScript functions were added to the User Interface Objects. Forms Tab : Moving items in an application : You can now move form items between pages of a form. Order of forms in a application : You can change the order of the forms within an application by dragging and dropping them in the Outline view. When the application is deployed and launched, the first form in the application becomes the default form seen by the user. Warning message on Save : does not support multiple people editing the same application. If you and another user edit the same application, and the other user saves changes while you are still editing, a warning message is now displayed asking if you want to overwrite the changes made by the other user. Date item loads current date : A new property is available for the Date field. When selected, if the user leaves the Date field empty, the current date is loaded upon form submission. If the user fills in the date field, the date supplied by the user is used. Single and Multi-Line entries uppercase : This new feature, located in the Basic tab of the Properties window lets you automatically change the user's entered text into upper case letters. Hiding Table buttons for Add, Edit, and Delete : In the Advanced tab for a Table , you can now set that no buttons are displayed with your table. The buttons can be enabled using JavaScript, if required. Manage Tab : Default sort order : Default sort order was changed so the most recently changed applications are listed at the top. Now you can quickly find recently modified applications. Alphabetical sorting is still available, but no longer the default. Redeploy after saving : When you edit an application, and save the changes you must redeploy the application for the changes to be implemented. A visual indicator is now displayed as a reminder when an application has changes that have not been deployed. Adding tags to an application : When you create a new application, you can add tags at the same time. Tags are used to search for applications in the Manage screen. Previously, you could only add tags to your application after it was created and listed in the Manage tab. Tags are separated by spaces, so if you need to make a multiple-word tag, use an underscore between the words. Access Tab : The \"All Authenticated Users\" group cannot be added to any role that has Edit permissions. Users can still be assigned individually, or as groups, to roles with edit permissions. This prevents your application from showing up in the Manage Tab for all authenticated users, and from their applications appearing on your Manage tab. You see only the applications you created, or those to which you have edit permissions. Rules : Naming Rules : You can now name and rename rules. Providing unique, descriptive names to rules makes them easier to find when building your application. See which item is used in a Rule : When a form item has a rule enabled, the Rules icon for the item contains a check mark. The check mark lets you quickly see which form items are involved in a rule. Stages : Stage Description : When you create a new Stage, you can add a detailed description. Adding descriptions is useful if you will have several similarly named stages that perform slightly different portions of the workflow. Rich Text Action Completion Message : The Action Completion Message is now a rich text field. Success message after submission : When a user completes and submits a form, the new default is to take the user away from the form and display the Action Completion Message. This reduces user confusion as they no longer see an empty, reloaded form on the screen. The existing options for the action taken upon form submission are still available in the Edit Form Properties window. View Responses : Individual Print, Email, and Delete buttons added : Print, email and delete buttons were added to each record row, so you can access them without opening each individual record. Email option contains the link to the record : The email operation emails the link to both print and launch the record. New fields added to Responses screen : \u201cCreated on\u201dand \u201cLast Updated By\u201d were added to the table so you can see additional information on each submitted form. Selected results open in a new window : When you click on a submitted record, it opens in a window, rather than in a side pane. Default view changed : When you click the View Responses link, the default view is now Responses , rather than Summary . A number of upgrade routine fixes, accessibility, and usability changes were implemented. Values entered into the password item are not stored in your application. Since the password is never stored, it is never exported or shown in any field. The password field is empty when the form is rendered in its next stage. Using the password for calling server-side services during stage transitions still work as the value is included as part of the submitted data and not stored as part of the application record.","title":"What's new in 9.3.5? {#whatsnew .concept}"},{"location":"whats_new%20-%20Copy.html#whatsnew","text":"For a full list of fixes by release, see this article .","title":"What's new in 9.3.5?"},{"location":"whats_new%20-%20Copy.html#new-features","text":"Bug fixes.","title":"New features"},{"location":"whats_new%20-%20Copy.html#934","text":"Bug fixes.

You can now import a list of choices from a spreadsheet into Select One , Select Many , and Dropdown form items. The lists can be comma separated, or space separated. If you copy two columns of choices from a spreadsheet, the first column is set as the Displayed Value, and the second column set as the Saved Value. In the Settings tab, under Files , you can now download any previously uploaded file. A Java 2 Connector (J2C) provider is now supported for use in the HTTP Service Transport with . A new openURL query parameter so you can dynamically set a application to open at run time. The Media form item is supported in Google Chrome via HTML5. Two new JavaScript functions were added to the User Interface Objects: setTabTitle and setTabTitleList . The amount of Stage Action data an application can have has been increased. General and security fixes. 8.6.1 Support for the following versions: Oracle 11g 10.5 8.5.5 Java 7 Derby 10.10.2 New features include: Document Integration : Where compliance or regulatory requirements mandate it, integrating captured data with existing documents can be an important part of the overall solution. These output documents can be provided for precise printing, document signing or archiving. Using a Service Configuration, you can map form items to PDF items. When the user clicks a button, the PDF is populated. For more information, see Leap document integration . Integration features Render parameters : Two public render parameters were added to provide additional portlet-to-portlet communication. Page refresh setting : A new page refresh setting is available in the Shared Settings . This property lets you set whether the portal page is refreshed when the form is submitted. Support for non-default portal context root : The Leap Portlet now supports portal with a non-default context root, or an empty context root. Script Portlet and DDC samples : Two new samples are available for usingwith . Both samples are available on the developerWorks\u00ae wiki. Additional in-product help : If you're new to , blue help bubbles describe the basic function of each page or section, as well as provide additional help resources. Additional hover help, and context sensitive help were added throughout the application. JSON is now supported in the : HTTP Transport JavaScript Data Access Rest API New JavaScript functionality : New JavaScript functions were added to the User Interface Objects. Forms Tab : Moving items in an application : You can now move form items between pages of a form. Order of forms in a application : You can change the order of the forms within an application by dragging and dropping them in the Outline view. When the application is deployed and launched, the first form in the application becomes the default form seen by the user. Warning message on Save : does not support multiple people editing the same application. If you and another user edit the same application, and the other user saves changes while you are still editing, a warning message is now displayed asking if you want to overwrite the changes made by the other user. Date item loads current date : A new property is available for the Date field. When selected, if the user leaves the Date field empty, the current date is loaded upon form submission. If the user fills in the date field, the date supplied by the user is used. Single and Multi-Line entries uppercase : This new feature, located in the Basic tab of the Properties window lets you automatically change the user's entered text into upper case letters. Hiding Table buttons for Add, Edit, and Delete : In the Advanced tab for a Table , you can now set that no buttons are displayed with your table. The buttons can be enabled using JavaScript, if required. Manage Tab : Default sort order : Default sort order was changed so the most recently changed applications are listed at the top. Now you can quickly find recently modified applications. Alphabetical sorting is still available, but no longer the default. Redeploy after saving : When you edit an application, and save the changes you must redeploy the application for the changes to be implemented. A visual indicator is now displayed as a reminder when an application has changes that have not been deployed. Adding tags to an application : When you create a new application, you can add tags at the same time. Tags are used to search for applications in the Manage screen. Previously, you could only add tags to your application after it was created and listed in the Manage tab. Tags are separated by spaces, so if you need to make a multiple-word tag, use an underscore between the words. Access Tab : The \"All Authenticated Users\" group cannot be added to any role that has Edit permissions. Users can still be assigned individually, or as groups, to roles with edit permissions. This prevents your application from showing up in the Manage Tab for all authenticated users, and from their applications appearing on your Manage tab. You see only the applications you created, or those to which you have edit permissions. Rules : Naming Rules : You can now name and rename rules. Providing unique, descriptive names to rules makes them easier to find when building your application. See which item is used in a Rule : When a form item has a rule enabled, the Rules icon for the item contains a check mark. The check mark lets you quickly see which form items are involved in a rule. Stages : Stage Description : When you create a new Stage, you can add a detailed description. Adding descriptions is useful if you will have several similarly named stages that perform slightly different portions of the workflow. Rich Text Action Completion Message : The Action Completion Message is now a rich text field. Success message after submission : When a user completes and submits a form, the new default is to take the user away from the form and display the Action Completion Message. This reduces user confusion as they no longer see an empty, reloaded form on the screen. The existing options for the action taken upon form submission are still available in the Edit Form Properties window. View Responses : Individual Print, Email, and Delete buttons added : Print, email and delete buttons were added to each record row, so you can access them without opening each individual record. Email option contains the link to the record : The email operation emails the link to both print and launch the record. New fields added to Responses screen : \u201cCreated on\u201dand \u201cLast Updated By\u201d were added to the table so you can see additional information on each submitted form. Selected results open in a new window : When you click on a submitted record, it opens in a window, rather than in a side pane. Default view changed : When you click the View Responses link, the default view is now Responses , rather than Summary . A number of upgrade routine fixes, accessibility, and usability changes were implemented. Values entered into the password item are not stored in your application. Since the password is never stored, it is never exported or shown in any field. The password field is empty when the form is rendered in its next stage. Using the password for calling server-side services during stage transitions still work as the value is included as part of the submitted data and not stored as part of the application record.","title":"What&apos;s new&quest;"},{"location":"whats_new.html#whats-new-in-935","text":"For a full list of fixes by release, see this article .","title":"What's new in 9.3.5?"},{"location":"whats_new.html#new-features","text":"Bug fixes.","title":"New features"},{"location":"whats_new.html#934","text":"Bug fixes.

You can use the Table form item to create a section where a user can submit repeated data. For example, in a job application you can build a table that asks for work history. You can create columns such as the \u201cCompany Name\u201d, \u201cJob Title\u201d, \u201cStart Date\u201d, and \u201cEnd Date\u201d. The user can add as many rows under these columns as required to provide their work history. In many cases, it is not feasible to add individual items for each repeating element as you cannot know in advance how many repeating elements the use requires. To achieve this functionality, the Table form item contains the following two complimentary elements: Child form \u2013 The Child form is a supporting form that contains the form items that collect the repeated data.
