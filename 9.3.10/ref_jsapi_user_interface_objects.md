# Interface objects { #userinterfaceobjects .reference }

The following topics describe and gives samples for interface objects that are used within the {{fullProductName}} JavaScriptâ„¢ API.

!!! note
    When you use JavaScript to modify form items, the change appears only in the user interface, it does not persist to the submitted data. The user completing the form sees the modifications that are made by your JavaScript, however a user reviewing submitted data sees the original form items. If you want the changes to appear in the form any time it is viewed, the JavaScript must be attached to events that run each time that the form is opened.
