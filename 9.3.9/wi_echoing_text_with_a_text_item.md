# Echoing text with a Text item { #echoingtextwithatextwidget .task}

You can use the Text item to echo text, or build a summary page.

Use the Text item from the Palette to create a header or title for your form. You can also use it to echo text, make a summary page, or to add a user’s name to the beginning of a form. The following instructions describe how to create a summary page on your form. The summary page displays a read-only version of the changes a user made before confirming a change. For example, if your application is a checkout feature where users enter billing and shipping information, you can set an echo text page to confirm their billing and shipping addresses before completing and confirming the order.

1.  In the Outline view insert a page by clicking the Ellipses \(…\) icon for **Page 1** and selecting “+ Add Form Page”.

    An empty form page appears.

2.  Drop a Text item onto the form.

3.  Click the newly created text item.

    The properties side panel opens.

4.  Enter the name of the Text item in the text area.

    For example, you might enter “Summary Page”.

5.  Under the **Content:** heading, click **Insert item**. Select the page and item you want to display on the summary page.

6.  Repeat for all of the items in your form you want to summarize.

    You can separate the selected items by spaces, commas, line breaks, or other formatting.
