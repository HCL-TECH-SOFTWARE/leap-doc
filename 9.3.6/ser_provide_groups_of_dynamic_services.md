You can develop, deploy, and use Service Catalogs and Service Catalog Groups within theHCL Leap environment.

-   **[Adding a Service Catalog Group](ser_add_service_catalog_group.md)**  
A Service Catalog Group provides a way to group web services in HCL Leap.
-   **[Adding a Service Catalog](ser_add_service_catalog.md)**  
A Service Catalog serves two purposes. First, a Service Catalog is a programmatic mechanism to dynamically provide Service Descriptions to HCL Leap instead of using static XML files. Second, a Service Catalog is linked to a Service Catalog Group and provides a mechanism to assign Service Descriptions to a specific Service Catalog Group.
