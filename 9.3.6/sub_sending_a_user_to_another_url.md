# Configuring behavior of a form on submission {#sendingausertoanotherurlaftercompletingaform .task}

Once a user completes an HCL Leap form, you can send them to another stage of that form.

After a user submits a form, you can show them the next stage of a form. For example, to confirm what they submitted by pressing a confirmation button, or to show a read-only copy of the information they submitted. You can also limit authenticated users from submitting multiple forms.

1.  Click the **Workflow tab**.

2.  Click the area outside the outline in the Workflow view.

    The form Properties displays on the side of the screen.

3.  In the **Upon Submission**: section, choose one of the following options:

    -   Show the success message page
    -   Show the success message in a dialog and then display a new form
    -   Show the success message in a dialog and then display the next stage of the form
