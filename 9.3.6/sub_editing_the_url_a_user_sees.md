# Redirecting users after form submission {#editingtheurlauserseesaftersubmittingaform .task}

The administrator of an HCL Leap application can add a URL that is triggered when a form is submitted.

You can set Leap to redirect the user to another application, URL, form, or app page upon form submission. Redirecting users to a secondary URL is useful if the user must complete another application that is directly related to the first. The user is redirected to the second URL in a dialog when the first form is submitted.

1.  Click the **Workflow** tab.

2.  Select the desired Stage button in the diagram.

3.  In the **Properties tab**, under **On action completion redirect to:**, select one of the following options from the drop-down:

    -   Another Leap application
    -   Website URL
    -   A Form or App Page
