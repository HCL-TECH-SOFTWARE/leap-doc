# Launching an application {#launchinganapplication .task}

After an HCL Leap application is deployed, the **Launch** link is enabled. When you click **Launch**, the live application opens in a new window.

You must deploy your application before you can launch it. See [Deploying an application](cr_deploying_an_application.md#) for instructions on how to deploy your application.

1.  To launch an application:

    -   Go to **Manage** tab, and click **Launch**. The application is launched in a web browser.
    -   Click the arrow head to the left of the application name. The application information window expands and displays the URL of the application. Copy the URL and paste it into a web browser, or disseminate it through email, or your web site.
