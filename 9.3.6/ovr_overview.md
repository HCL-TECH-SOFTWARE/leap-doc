# Overview {#overview .concept}

HCL Leap builds dynamic forms and applications with a web-based interface. From a single interface, you can design a form, define access privileges, create workflow stages, deploy the application, and review submitted results.

Leap makes creating forms easier than before by dramatically reducing the time and effort that is required to deliver compelling, interactive applications. The simple web-based user interface allows a web designer to quickly assemble a series of application screens for web forms. You can also capture data into a relational database and orchestrate notifications with an integrated workflow. Data that is captured in Leap is easily integrated into existing line-of-business systems with a drag-and-drop web service interface. When users submit forms, you can view summary charts, inspect collected responses, or export data records to a spreadsheet program for detailed analysis.
