# Running a formula from an event {#runningaformulafromanevent .task}

After you add General formulas using the Settings tab, you can use the formulas when running events. For example, you can set a formula to run when a user clicks a button.

General formulas by default run whenever a form item is changed by the user. You can set formulas to run upon a specific event. For example, if a customer is entering information into an order form, you can set a formula to calculate sales tax and a subtotal when the user clicks a button. To run a formula when a user clicks a button:

1.  Add a button to your form.

2.  Select the newly added button.

    The Properties side panel opens.

3.  Click the **Events** tab.

4.  Select **onClick** from the list of Client Side events.

    The onClick options window opens.

5.  Select **Run a Formula**.

    -   Click the list to reveal the list of General formula created in the Settings tab.
    -   Click **Add/Edit Formula** to create a formula.
6.  After you either select or create the formula, click **OK** to close the onClick window.
