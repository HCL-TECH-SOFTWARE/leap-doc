# Managing the files associated with your application {#managingthefilesassociatedwithyourapplication .concept}

You can upload a variety of files, such as images, for use with your application. Managing these embedded files is done in the Files section of the Settings tab

You can upload files such as images, JavaScriptâ„¢, or CSS files from the **Settings** tab. Files are also uploaded using many form items, such as Media, Image, Button, Page Navigation, and Text, when creating your form.

Once a file is uploaded, use the file manager to update, copy or delete files. HCL Leap maintains references on the relationships between the files and where they are placed on the form. The files stored in the file manager are also exported with the application.
