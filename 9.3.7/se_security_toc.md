# Securing {#securitytoc .concept}

When building applications, user roles require various levels of security access. A manager is able to review submitted forms, but an administrator can delete them. The following topics describe how to set security levels for all levels of users.

Leap allows application designers to compose applications that combine user interfaces, data records, and a stages-based lifecycle. The Leap security settings govern access to applications and data by defining who can edit, maintain, deploy applications, and access data for submitted forms.

You can define your security rules using the **Access** tab from within the Design environment. These topics describe the Leap security concepts and how to use the Access tab to grant access to users in your organization.

-   **[Defining basic security roles for users](as_define_security_roles.md)**  
Create roles for users in your organization so they can work with data that is relevant to them.
-   **[Assigning users or groups to roles](as_assigning_users_or_groups_to_roles.md)**  
Give the users in your organization permission to work with the data relevant to them by assigning them roles.
-   **[Setting Stage permissions](as_setting_stage_permissions.md)**  
Setting Stage permissions defines the “Create”, “Read”, “Update”, and “Delete” permissions for each role in a stage.
-   **[Defining permissions to share data with other applications](se_permission_for_sharing_data_with_other_apps.md)**  
HCL Leap applications can share data through services with other Leap applications. To allow other applications access to the data from the application you are designing, you must define the security permissions.
-   **[Assigning users to maintain the application](as_assigning_users_to_maintain_the_application.md)**  
To define who can edit an HCL Leap application, use the design settings in the **Access** tab.
-   **[Setting up security for anonymous access](as_setting_up_security_for_anon_access.md)**  
Using the correct permissions, you can allow anonymous users to access a form.
