# Copying items {#cr_copying_items .concept}

Items may be copied from one form to another form within any application.

If you want to copy an item from one form to another, select the item and press **Ctrl+C**. Select the target form and press **Ctrl+V**. If a cell on the target form's page is selected, the copy is inserted there, otherwise it will be inserted into the first available cell on that page. If there is no empty cell, then a new row will be added with the pasted item.

**Note:** Table items cannot be copied.

**Note:** Copying an entire page is not supported at this time.
