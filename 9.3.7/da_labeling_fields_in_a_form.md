# Adding data labels to form items {#labelingfieldsinaform .task}

Data labels added to form items provide descriptive column names when data is exported to a spreadsheet. If no data label is assigned, the Display Value is used.

Display Values are shown to users when they view forms. While informative, Display Values may not make the best column headings. When analyzing an exported spreadsheet, a descriptive Data Label provides a column name, and gives context to the data viewed outside of the form. The following instructions describe how to add Data Labels to form items:

1.  Select the form item to reveal the properties side panel.

2.  Add text in the **Data Label** field. When you export the data, the text you entered in the data label becomes the name of the column.
