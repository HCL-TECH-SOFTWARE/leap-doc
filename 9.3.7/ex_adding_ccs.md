# Adding customized CSS to your application {#addingcustomizedcascadingstylesheets .task}

You can add custom cascading style sheet \(CSS\) themes to your HCL Leap application.

Adding custom cascading style sheet \(CSS\) themes personalizes applications with the branding of your organization.

1.  Click the **Style** tab.

2.  Click **Add file**.

    The Add File or URL Link window opens.

3.  Select your custom style sheet:

    -   **Add a file from your computer** – Browse to the file location on your computer.
    -   **Use a file on the internet** – insert the URL of file location. Select whether you want to**Import the file from the internet** or **Maintain a link to the file only**.
    The name of the file is automatically entered into the **Name** field. You can change the name of the file, but ensure the .css file extension remains. You can also enter a description of the file, which is useful if you have several similarly named style sheets.

4.  Click **OK** to save changes and close the window.

5.  To replace the built-in theme, select **Replace built-in theme**.

    You can use the built-in style sheets to complement your CSS, or you can replace them entirely with your CSS file with this option.


After a style sheet is uploaded, you can select it from the drop-down menu. While you can upload many custom style sheets, you can select only one per application.

**Note:** To see the style sheet that is applied to your application, either preview, or save and deploy the application.

See [Creating customized Cascading Style Sheets](ref_customized_css.md) for information about creating your own custom CSS.
