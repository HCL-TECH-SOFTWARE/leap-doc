# Adding media to a form {#addingmediatoaform .task}

You can add media to the form anywhere you place the Media form item.

The Media item supports .avi, .mpeg, .mpg, .wmv, .wma, .mov, .mp3, .mp4, and .swf file types. When you use the Media item in an HCL Leap application, it is important to use a media type that renders properly in the supported browsers that you expect your users to use. The ability to render a specific media type is dependent on the browser configuration and which plug-ins they installed.

**Note:** Ensure that you have proper spacing between **Media** form items and other form items that require pop-ups, such as **Calendar**. If these types of form items are too close together, the **Media** item blocks the pop-ups of the other form items.

1.  In the Palette, click **Specialized**.

    The list of specialized form items expands.

2.  Select **Media** and drop it onto the form.

3.  The properties side panel appears so you can configure the media file.

4.  Click **Add file** to upload a file, or point to a URL that hosts the file.

    Or you can select previously uploaded media from the **Media** drop-down menu.

    1.  To set a media item to display on an iPad, click **Use a file on the internet**.

    2.  Set the URL for the file, then select **Maintain a link to the file only**. Click **OK**.

5.  Configure the viewing options by adjusting the **Show Control**, **Auto Start**, and **Loop** radio buttons. Adjust the height and width of the view with the fields provided.

6.  Your changes are saved automatically.
