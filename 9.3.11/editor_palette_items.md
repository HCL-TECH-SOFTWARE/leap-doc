# Which palette item should I use?

The widgets (or items from the palette) you use in your form significantly influence how the form behaves at runtime (while you end users are filling out the form), the design options available for you, and how easily data is interpreted on the **View Data** page.

When designing forms, select items that best align with the data types of your questions. For instance, use the **Number** item for numeric questions instead of a **Single Line Entry** field. The **Number** field automatically validates numeric input  when a user fills in the form and allows you to define acceptable ranges. Additionally, data from Number fields can be easily summarized in charts and graphs on the View Data page, whereas data from Single Line Entry fields cannot.

Proper widget selection is crucial, as changing a widget type will result in the loss of existing data. For example, replacing a **Single Line Entry** field with a **Currency** field will erase all previously submitted data from the original field. Therefore, carefully consider the appropriate item types during form design to preserve data integrity.

Using the correct widget types also allows you to easily build **Rules** and **Formulas** into your form, as the Rules and Formula's tabs use the type of item to help you build your logic. 

There are various specialized items available in the palette, each designed with specific validation and configuration options to ensure accurate data captured. For instance, use **Date** fields for date information, **Time** fields for times of day, **Currency** fields for monetary values, and others.  Its also important to understand what types of items will be automatically summarized in the charts and graphs of the **View Data** page.

The following table describes each item type and what type of specialized properties can be set in its **Properties** as well as an indicator that lets you know if it will automatically be summarized as a chart in the **View Data** page.
