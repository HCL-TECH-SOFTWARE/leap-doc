# Swagger UI

The open source [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) is embedded in {{shortProductName}} to simplify and accelerate integration using {{shortProductName}}'s REST APIs.  This page allows you to inspect and test different REST API operations.

Direct links to this page for application and form operations are available in the **URL Links** dropdown of an expanded application on the Manage page.

To load other api definitions modify the 'url' parameter. For example, http://myLeapServer.com/{{context}}/open/swagger-ui/index.html?url=%2Fsecure%2Forg%2Fapp%2Fopenapi.json

## Limitations

- You must be logged in for the Swagger UI to properly access and load the api definitions (openapi.json). If the page displays ***"Failed to load API definition"***, it could be that you are not authenticated or that your session has timed out. Reauthenticate to restore access to the api definition.

- The Swagger UI can only be used to load openapi.json files that are on the same server. Loading external files has been blocked.

- Only users with Administrator role (or a role with "create" permission) may access the api definition for a specific application.
