# Domino Leap configuration settings

Domino Leap configuration settings are in **VoltConfig.nsf** in the volt folder of your Domino data directory (volt/VoltConfig.nsf). Use the Notes client or the Domino Administrator client to modify a configuration setting.

To modify a configuration setting, complete the following steps:

1. Use Notes or the Administrator client to open volt/VoltConfig.nsf.

2. Select **All Settings**.

3. Find the setting you want to modify. For more information, see [configuration properties](co_configuration_properties.md).

4. Open the setting document.

5. Click **Edit** to modify the setting.

6. If the setting is disabled, click **Enable Setting**.

7. If necessary, modify the **Setting Value** field. See the description of each setting for a list of legal values.

8. Click **Done** and select **Yes** to save your changes.

Domino Leap typically reads a setting change within a minute or two. If your change does not take effect automatically, you may need to restart the HTTP process.

## Configuration properties

For the full list, see [configuration properties](co_configuration_properties.md). The most common configuration properties can be found in **VoltConfig.nsf**. In each case, the document in **VoltConfig.nsf** includes a description of the setting.
