## Contributing

Bug reports on **product documentation** and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/HCL-TECH-SOFTWARE/leap-doc. 
This is the Leap documenation site and not a product support platform. All bug reports and pull requests must pertain to product documentation. 

Updates may be performed only to markdown files under **leap-doc/9.3.5**.

### Updating the documentation and validating changes

- Clone the [Leap documentation repository](https://github.com/HCL-TECH-SOFTWARE/leap-doc) and create a working branch.
- Edit the markdown in **leap-doc/9.3.5** as needed.
- If you want to check the appearance of your changes in HTML, use MKDcos to build and Visual Studio to see the html.

### Submitting documentation changes

- Open a [Pull Request](https://github.com/HCL-TECH-SOFTWARE/leap-doc/pulls).
- Respond to review comments as needed.
- You will be notified when your changes have been merged. They will appear on the public site the next time the documentation is built.
