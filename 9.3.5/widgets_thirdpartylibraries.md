# Incorporating third-party libraries {#widgets_thirdpartylibraries .concept}

This topic describes incorporating third-party libraries.

-   3rd-party libraries are expected to be bundled and loaded in an isolated manner so that they do not pollute the global namespace or interfere with the product code, in the current release or future releases
-   Usage of the product's 3rd-party libraries is not supported; these may change or be removed at any time.
