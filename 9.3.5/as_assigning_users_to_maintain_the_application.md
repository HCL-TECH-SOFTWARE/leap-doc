# Assigning users to maintain the application {#assigninguserstomaintaintheapplication .task}

To define who can edit an HCL Leap application, use the design settings in the **Access** tab.

By default, only administrators can edit and maintain an application. However, you can also assign other roles to do the task. In the **Manage** tab, an administrator can grant permission for other users to edit applications.

1.  To change who can edit an application, click **Design Settings** in the **Access** tab.

    The Design Settings table opens, displaying roles and their access permissions.

2.  To grant or remove edit permission from a user role, click the **Edit** check box next to that role.
