# Setting a language {#settingalanguage .task}

The default language for an application is based on the web browser locale. You can change the language of your HCL Leap application in the **Settings** tab.

To set a language for an application other than your default locale:

1.  Go to the **Settings** tab.

2.  Expand the **Application Language** menu and select either:

    -   a specific language from the list
    -   “User’s Language”
3.  Optional: Specify the language by expanding the **Application Regional Options** menu, and selecting a country where the language is used.

4.  If you want the language setting to apply to an application other than the one you are currently editing, enter the **Application Name** in the field.

    The field is automatically populated with the name of the current application.

5.  Click **Save** to apply the changes.
