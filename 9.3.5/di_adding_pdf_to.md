# Adding a PDF to Leap {#addingapdftofeb .task}

The following instructions describe how to add a PDF to Leap.

1.  Go to **Settings** \> **Files**.

2.  Click **Add**.

    The Add File or URL Link window opens.

3.  Select your PDF:

    -   **Add a file from your computer** – **Browse** to the file location on your computer.
    The name of the file is automatically entered into the **Name** field. You can change the name of the file, but ensure the .pdf file extension remains. You can also enter a description of the file, which is useful if you have several similarly named PDFs.

    **Note:** The name of the file is displayed to users when they populate the PDF.

4.  Click **OK** to save changes and close the window.

5.  **Save** the application.

    **Note:** You must save the application after the PDF is loaded. Without saving the application, the PDF is not available when you attempt to create a Service Configuration.
