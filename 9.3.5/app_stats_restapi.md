# Application statistics REST API {#app_stats_restapi .concept}

Application statistics REST API exposes statistics data on all applications, such as an application's last updated date, record count, attachment size etc.

Statistics are collected by a timer task which can be configured by an administrator using [Configuration properties](co_configuration_properties.md).

-   Authentication

    All REST API calls must be made as an authenticated user in Administrator or Super Administrator role. If you want to exercise the API with code, you may use basic authentication. The primary mechanism is to use basic authentication where the username and password are a Base64 encoded string.

-   REST actions

    The following table lists the types of actions that are available and the URLs associated with those actions.
