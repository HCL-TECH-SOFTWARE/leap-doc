# Enabling dynamic layout {#enablingdynamiclayout .task}

When you build applications, you can now set the display width of your Leap application. Setting this feature reduces or removes the need for horizontal scrolling when you have an unknown or limited amount of space, such as when the application is displayed in a WebSphere\_Portal portlet.

To set dynamic width on a page:

1.  In the **Outline** menu, click the **Properties** icon for the desired page.

    The Properties side panel opens.

2.  In the **Width:** options, select **Dynamic Value**, and enter a minimum and maximum value.

    **Note:** If you click the green plus sign to add another page to your application, the values you set are automatically copied to the new page.

3.  To set Dynamic Layout on a page or in a section:

4.  Click the check box beside **Enable dynamic layout**, and set the minimum window width.

5.  Select whether the user sees form items in single column mode, or in carousel mode.

    The default is single column mode.

    **Note:** If you have or add a Section on the page, the Dynamic Layout settings of the Page are duplicated in the Section. For best results, Carousel mode should be used on forms that do not contain sections.
