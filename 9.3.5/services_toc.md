# Adding services {#addingservicestofeb .task}

The following topics describe how to add services to your Leap applications.

-   **[Setting up your development environment](ser_setup_development_environment.md)**  
The HCL Leap runs within an OSGi framework environment. Code that extends the Leap needs to be packaged within OSGi bundles to run. Any Java™ development environment can be used to create custom bundles, but using the Eclipse IDE built-in OSGi tooling is recommended to minimize effort and errors.
-   **[Providing Groups of Dynamic Services](ser_provide_groups_of_dynamic_services.md)**  
You can develop, deploy, and use Service Catalogs and Service Catalog Groups within theHCL Leap environment.
-   **[Service Oriented Architecture – Service Transport](ex_soa_service_transport.md)**  
HCL Leap has a powerful, and extensible, Service Oriented Architecture \(SOA\) integration feature. The foundation of this feature is the Service Transport.
