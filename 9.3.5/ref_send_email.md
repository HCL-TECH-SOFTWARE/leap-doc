# Send Email service 

This topic provides reference information on the Send Email service in HCL Leap.

## Purpose {#section_jkm_qck_d1c .section}

The Send Email service provides a mechanism to send an email from a Leap application. The service enables an application author to bind fields from their form to the parameters of the service and it can be executed at any time, which is what distinguishes it from the submit activity email functionality \(which can only be sent as part of a submit event\).

This feature is disabled by default and must be enabled by the administrator. To enable this service, add \(or modify\) the following property in the Leap\_config.properties:

``` {#codeblock_und_tck_d1c}
ibm.nitro.NitroConfig.enableEmailService=true
```

Leap does not need to be restarted, but it may take a few minutes for the service to appear in the authoring environment.

## Service parameters {#section_qgm_tck_d1c .section}

|**Parameter**|**Definition**|
|-------|--------|
|To| One or more addresses to be used as the primary email target.|
|CC|One or more addresses to which the email will be sent as cc.|
|BCC|One or more addresses to which the email will be sent as bcc.|

|Subject|The text to be used for the email subject.|
|Text Content|Plain text content to be used for the email body.|
|HTML Content|HTML content to be used for the email body.|
