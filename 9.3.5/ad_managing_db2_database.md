# Backing up and restoring the DB2 database {#managingyourdb2database .concept}

Data for HCL Leap applications is stored within a database. Ensure that you have a backup and restore strategy in place to protect your data.

Backing up and restoring data in DB2® is done using the **Backup** and **Restore** commands. If you plan to restore data from a server with a different bit order than the one currently storing the data, you must use the Data Movement Tool. For more information, see [Data Movement Tool](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/data/library/techarticle/dm-0906datamovement/).
