# Adding tables and workflow elements to a HCL Leap form {#addingworkflowtoaform .learningOverview}

This tutorial provides information and lessons about more advanced Leap topics. Basic form design is not covered in this tutorial.

## Prerequisites { .lcIntro}

This tutorial contains the following lessons:

-   Tables – Adding tables to your form to collect data from users.
-   Stages – Adding workflow to your form, turning it into an application. The Stages section covers both basic workflow and conditional workflow.
-   Access – Adding permissions to the stages on your form, which allows specific people to access the form at different points in the workflow.

If you have no experience with Leap, complete the [Building a Survey application](tut_survey_application_OV.md) tutorial to learn the basics of building and deploying applications in Leap. This tutorial does not cover concepts of form design, deployment, or reviewing submitted data.

Go to the Leap community on [developerWorks](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/groups/service/html/communityview?communityUuid=05651788-f17f-4309-a5c6-698e67acd9c1#fullpageWidgetId=W4a73531d1336_45a7_b2a2_181d0f91c219&file=146985fb-d8c3-4770-b330-c7c6cafc5925), and import ExpenseReport.nitro\_s into Leap. Use the following instructions to complete the partially complete Expense Report application.

-   **[Adding tables to forms](tut_roles_and_stages_module1.md#)**  
Adding tables to your form is a useful way to gather information from users in a contained space. You can specify exactly what information you want the user to enter by selecting form items to use as the table headings. The user can add as many rows into the table as required to submit their data, but the table is contained within a predefined size on the page.
-   **[Adding workflow Stages to a form](tut_roles_and_stages_module2.md#)**  
Leap uses Stages to add workflow to your form. Workflow describes various lifecycle steps that are associated with the form. Defining multiple connected Stages creates the workflow, where each stage defines its own form behavior, access rights, and navigation steps. In this tutorial, define the workflow steps that are required for the approval of the form.
-   **[Applying access control through Roles](tut_roles_and_stages_module3.md#)**  
Access control defines who is able to view and modify the form in different stages. For example, only the form administrator can change the layout of the form, while user access is restricted to opening and submitting the form. Creating this access control is done with Roles.
-   **[Tutorial summary](tut_roles_and_stages_SM.md#)**  
You successfully completed this tutorial, which demonstrated an application with workflow and access permissions.
