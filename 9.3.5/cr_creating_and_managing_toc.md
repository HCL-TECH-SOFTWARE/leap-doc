# Creating and managing applications {#creatingandmanagingapplicationstoc .concept}

Creating and managing applications contains a variety of topics on how to build and efficiently use applications.

-   **[Creating an application](cr_creating_application_overview.md)**  
This topic gives a general overview of the application creation process, from opening the HCL Leap interface to launching a completed application.
-   **[Creating an application from an excel spreadsheet](cr_creating_application_excel.md)**  
Leap allows you to create an application from an excel spreadsheet, automatically creating the widgets and importing the data found in the spreadsheet.
-   **[Styling your application with a custom theme](cr_custom_theme.md)**  
Style the colors, fonts, and other characteristics of the application by creating or importing a custom theme.
-   **[Upgrading an application design](upgrade_application_design.md)**  
The upgrade feature allows an application design to be replaced by a new version.
-   **[Copying items](cr_copying_items.md)**  
Items may be copied from one form to another form within any application.
-   **[Moving items on a form](cr_moving_items_on_a_form.md)**  
Form items are not static after they are added to a form. You can move items around on a single page, duplicate form items, and move items between pages on your form.
-   **[Creating an accessible application](ac_creating_accessible_application.md)**  
When you create a form or application, the following information helps you design an accessible form for users with disabilities.
-   **[Enabling dynamic layout](cr_enabling_dynamic_layout.md)**  
When you build applications, you can now set the display width of your Leap application. Setting this feature reduces or removes the need for horizontal scrolling when you have an unknown or limited amount of space, such as when the application is displayed in a WebSphere\_Portal portlet.
-   **[Globalization features](gl_forms_experience_builder_globalization.md)**  
The following information describes the languages formatting features supported by HCL Leap.
-   **[Creating rules in your application](ru_creating_rules_in_your_form.md)**  
Rules help you gather the correct information from users and organize your information after data is entered in a form. You can create composite rules that govern how your form, and the data in your form behaves.
-   **[Labeling data, performing data analysis, and exporting data](da_data_analysis_and_exporting_data.md)**  
You can add labels to data elements in your application that become the label in the export file.
-   **[Incorporating web services into your applications](cr_using_apps_as_services_toc.md)**  
The following topics describe how to incorporate web services into your HCL Leap application.
-   **[Adding formulas to your application](cr_adding_formulas_toc.md)**  
You can create and edit formulas to assign values to an item on your HCL Leap form.
-   **[Adding specialized form items](wi_introduction_to_specialized_form_items.md)**  
You can use specialized form items to style text, echo text back, create dynamic lines, or add HTML.
-   **[Managing the files associated with your application](wf_managing_the_files_associated_with_your_appl.md)**  
You can upload a variety of files, such as images, for use with your application. Managing these embedded files is done in the Files section of the Settings tab
-   **[Leap document integration](di_pop_doc_with_app_data.md)**  
Leap's document integration feature lets you use previously built PDF files and populate them with data captured by Leap.
-   **[Adding Stages to an application](sub_adding_stages_toc.md)**  
It is often desirable to have an application, or form, transition through a set of phases or stages. At each stage the form might be used by different people in different roles. The form also might be presented in a slightly different manner in each stage, such as having some items or pages hidden, or in a read-only state.
-   **[Deploying applications and viewing data responses](cr_deploy_and_launch_toc.md)**  
After an HCL Leap application is built it must be deployed. After it is deployed, you can supply users with the URL of the application so they can launch it. After users submit completed forms, you can view the responses.
