# Updating and stopping a deployment {#updatingandstoppingadeployment .task}

The following instructions describe how to update, or stop, the deployment of an HCL Leap application.

There are many reasons why you might need to update, or stop, a deployed application. You might want to update the deployment parameters, such as adding a start and stop date. Or, you might need to stop the deployment to perform updates to the application, and do not want to impact existing data. To update, or stop, a deployment:

1.  Go to the **Manage** tab and click **Deploy** for the application.

    The Deployment Setting window opens.

2.  Modify the deployment settings:

    -   To update a deployment, update the deployment settings and click **Update**.
    -   To stop the deployment, click **Stop**.

        **Note:** If you want to set a Deployment period, you must stop the deployment first, set the **Start** and **Stop** dates, then deploy the application again.
