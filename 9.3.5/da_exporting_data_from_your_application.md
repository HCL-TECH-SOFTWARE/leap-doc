# Exporting data from your application {#exportingdatafromyourapplication .task}

After users complete and submit forms, you can export the data to a spreadsheet.

HCL Leap exports the data from your application to an Atom feed in XML format, JSON JavaScript™ Object Notification file, an OpenDocument spreadsheet, or Microsoft™ Excel. By default, all data for a specific application to which you have access is exported, unless you restrict the data set using Search.

1.  From the Manage tab, click **View Data** under the application you want to export.

2.  Click the **Responses** tab and select **Export Data**.

3.  Click the **Export To** to button and select the format of the file you want.
