You can create and edit formulas to assign values to an item on your {{fullProductName}} form.

There are two places within {{shortProductName}} where you can access the Formula editor:

-   The Formula tab of the Properties side panel.
-   The Formula menu item from the **Settings** tab.

-   **[Creating a Formula from the Properties side panel](cr_adding_formulas_from_properties_window.md)**  
You can set a formula on a form item using the Properties side panel. The following instructions describe how to open the Formula editor and the formula options available.
-   **[Creating a formula from the Settings tab](cr_adding_formula_from_settings_tab.md)**  
The Settings tab contains a Formula section from which you can view and create formulas.
-   **[Running a formula from an event](cr_adding_formula_running_formula_from_event.md)**  
After you add General formulas using the Settings tab, you can use the formulas when running events. For example, you can set a formula to run when a user clicks a button.
